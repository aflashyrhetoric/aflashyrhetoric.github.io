      <p>Today, I got the awesome opportunity to represent one of <a href="https://nulab-inc.com">Nulab</a>&rsquo;s apps, Typetalk.</p>

<p>I donned my Nulab tee and hoodie, strapped on the goldenrod &ldquo;Tech Day Exhibitor&rdquo; bracelet, and walked into the sprawling space. At first, I saw the big names - AWS, American Airlines, Vimeo. I continued to the rear end of the space, where we had a table. Japanese candies, t-shirts &amp; totes, business cards, iPads, Macbook Pros with our apps on full-screen - we&rsquo;re ready.</p>

<p>10AM rolls around and the visitors start coming. Tweens start sniffing the air for free merch. Businessmen representing B2B companies do a long of hand-shaking. Booth &ldquo;exhibitors&rdquo; all seem apprehensive. The horde of attendees begin inching towards our eye-catching purple backdrop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, we&rsquo;re Nulab! We create collaborative apps for modern teams!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few of them nod, grab a t-shirt and some candy, then beeline to the next booth. I overhear an attendee say, &ldquo;I come to just one of these a year to grab merch, and I never have to shop for clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I silently roll my eyes, my cynicism peeking its head. I remembered my past experiences at similar trade shows and grit my teeth for the cringey, gimmicky commercial showboating to come. My time spent in university businesses classes left me with a revulsion for terms like &ldquo;weak tie&rdquo; and &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo;. And here I was, preparing to use elevator pitches to build weak ties and build interest among Mark Cuban wannabes. Well, I&rsquo;m exaggerating, but only slightly - that&rsquo;s legitimately what I thought I&rsquo;d be doing.</p>

<p>But I was completely wrong. The vast majority of visitors to our table consisted of entrepreneurs, freelancers, students, and teachers with a sincere interest in learning more. Ambitious students, in formal dress, with a genuine interest in what our apps did and how they were built. Some visitors were happy with their existing solutions - which is great! - but others seemed intrigued by the way our apps worked to solve many of the frustration points they faced in their work. I ditched the elevator pitch I had prepared almost immediately and just simply began to have earnest conversations with them about their current tools and processes. It was awesome.</p>

<p>A few hours in, and I had spoken to over twenty people or so. I decided to take a walk around to see what the other booths were about.</p>

<p>My god. I saw a furniture company offering a wooden block that had a touch interface and embedded LED lights that made a basic 8-bit display so you could check weather, email, etc. One company aimed to revolutionize vibrators. A dog-walking business. A company selling little anthromorphic robo-assistants. Huge companies and small, 6-man teams.</p>

<p>And while there was certainly those &ldquo;gimmicky&rdquo; booths (one booth offered cronuts to those who won a Pachinko game - ðŸ˜‚), what I actually saw dispelled years of perceived elitism and pretense. The commercial showboaters were the vast minority. Everyone else: people having real conversations that lasted for more than just 30-seconds to a minute. Strangers coming together to discuss perplexing new technologies. It was a sight to behold.</p>
