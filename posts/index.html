                      In this one TED talk, Malcolm Gladwell told a story about how the U.S. military once spent $3 billion dollars developing a &ldquo;scope&rdquo; (as in, a telescopic sight for a weapon) for planes to attack their targets with terrifying accuracy. When it worked, it was considered revolutionary. The so-called Norden Bombsight made it possible to &ldquo;drop bombs into a pickle barrel from 20,000 feet.&rdquo; God-like accuracy for the time.
However - Gladwell later laments that regardless of the US Military&rsquo;s newfound technical capability, it led to little actual progress because:

There are times when the difference between two choices is completely lateral‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätwo substitutable alternatives that are equal in importance and consequence. If you‚Äôre craving some fruit, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you choose the apple or the orange. In these instances, it‚Äôs okay to defer to preference, precedent, or a coin toss. But these cases are the (rare) exception, not the rule.

I once heard two friends arguing. One of them had recently come upon a windfall of cash, and wanted to make a big purchase: an upscale sports car. Upon hearing this, his miserly friend fired back, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even go places! Don‚Äôt buy a Porsche to drive to 711.‚Äù
When I heard this biting exchange, I chuckled.

In 2005, psychologist Barry Schwartz took the stage at TEDGlobal in Oxford and proposed an idea: that ‚Äúmore is less.‚Äù You can watch the full video here, but the core idea is simple. To quote Schwartz, ‚ÄúWith so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.‚Äù He tells a simple anecdote to that effect: many years ago, when he walked into a clothing store, there were only a few pairs of jeans to choose from.
