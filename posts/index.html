I once heard two friends arguing. One of them had recently come upon a windfall of cash, and wanted to make a big purchase: an upscale sports car. Upon hearing this, his miserly friend fired back, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even go places! Don‚Äôt buy a Porsche to drive to 711.‚Äù
When I heard this biting exchange, I chuckled.

In 2005, psychologist Barry Schwartz took the stage at TEDGlobal in Oxford and proposed an idea: that ‚Äúmore is less.‚Äù You can watch the full video here, but the core idea is simple. To quote Schwartz, ‚ÄúWith so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.‚Äù He tells a simple anecdote to that effect: many years ago, when he walked into a clothing store, there were only a few pairs of jeans to choose from.
