<p>Front-end build tools allow us to transpile, bundle, and optimize assets in various ways.</p>
<p>Now, technically, <code>webpack</code> is a module bundler and doesn't quite fit in with Gulp and Grunt, which are &ldquo;task runners,&rdquo; but since there is great overlap in the functionality offered by each tool, I'll just refer to them all collectively as &ldquo;build tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grunt came first - let's start with that.</p>
<h4 id="grunt">Grunt</h4>
<p>Grunt is a task runner. Like all build tools, it uses a modular, plugin-type system.</p>
<p>Its execution can be configured using a <code>Gruntfile.js</code>. This file uses a declarative style of configuration to <em>describe</em> the changes. In other words, the Gruntfile doesn't get &ldquo;run&rdquo; or &ldquo;executed&rdquo;. Once you run the <code>grunt</code> command, the Grunt process will look for the Gruntfile and subsequently parse it to extract the configuration. Using this config, it will perform a variety of tasks, like transpiling SCSS to CSS, uglifying Javascript, copying image assets to a designated output folder, and so on.</p>
<h4 id="gulp">Gulp</h4>
<p>Gulp is also a task runner. It also uses a modular, plugin system.</p>
<p>It uses a file called <code>gulpfile.js</code>. However, this particular file is essentially a script that <em>can</em> be run. This means that your build tool's configuration can now be given sequential instructions instead of just a grab bag of values.</p>
<p>Similar to Grunt, you can transpile and uglify code, copy assets, and more. However, because this is a program that gets &ldquo;run&rdquo;, you can use standard Javascript methods to <em>code</em> your configuration instead of <em>describing</em> its execution. Queue excitement over being able to use ES6 in config files.</p>
<p>This lets you control more intuitively the order in which tasks get executed: you can minify first, or copy first, or whatever. (Gulp's syntax enables you to chain methods.)</p>
<h4 id="webpack">Webpack</h4>
<p>Webpack is a <em>module bundler</em>.</p>
<p>Let's break this down. In Webpack's eyes, all sites and applications can be described in a modular fashion: as discrete chunks of functionality that cooperate to achieve the final result. Each module is seen as having its own set of &ldquo;dependencies&rdquo; - things that it needs to run as expected. This can be a traditional code dependency (ie: <code>import someModule from 'some-npm-package';</code>), but Webpack abstracts it further: <em>anything</em> that a module needs to run is seen as a &ldquo;dependency.&rdquo; That could mean an SVG image, an image, an MP3 file, an SVG, or more. After all - sites aren't just <em>code</em>. They are a mishmosh of varied things.</p>
<p>Webpack's game is optimization, and it gives you several tools to that end, but it can be mindbending. Why, for example, should your homepage's code contain CSS for the <code>about/</code> page? The user doesn't need the <code>about/</code> page code, images, and fonts yet, so why send it to them?</p>
<p>The <code>Homepage</code>, then can be seen as a &ldquo;module&rdquo; with a set of dependencies, while the <code>About</code> page can be its own separate module. So on and so forth. In fact, Webpack gives you the tools to take it a step further with lazy loading. In the same way that the User doesn't need the About page code on the Homepage, so too does the User <strong>not</strong> need the footer code at the top of a page. So then, the homepage could be 2 modules rather than one: firstly, the code for all &ldquo;components&rdquo; above-the-fold, and a second module for components below-the-fold. Initially, the first module is loaded only. If the user begins to scroll and it seems like they intend to see the rest of the page, <em>then</em> the second module can be loaded.</p>
<p>Webpack uses a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file and also uses a declarative syntax to allow you to describe these dependency relationships using standard <code>.json</code> syntax. When <code>webpack</code> is run, it will parse the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, examine the relationships, calculate each module's dependencies, and output them however it needs to.</p>
