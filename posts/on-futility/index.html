    <p>An elderly woman wakes up at 7AM on a brisk Saturday morning. She picks up a bucket of white paint - an impulse buy from a week prior at a local Sherwin-Williams. Grabbing a brush and a tattered rag, she walks to the backyard.</p>
<p>She lives in the lower level of a duplex, so the backyard is hers. Lining the perimeter is an old fence - rusty streaks snake downward from every unsealed joint and the sight casts a macabre pallor over the space. But the paint she bought was a bright white, with built-in primer. &ldquo;The good stuff,&rdquo; the salesman had said. And today was the perfect day to paint.</p>
<p>She stirs the paint, dips the brush, and makes quick work of the fence.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, she checks her handiwork - all the stray drips and flecks <em>add</em> to the look, she decides.</p>
<p>She looks up, ignoring the muted spark of pain in her neck, the tired throb in her wrist from painting, and inhales the sky. It&rsquo;s important to be spontaneous, she thinks.</p>
<p>A hundred nearby Alexa devices pipe up. Something about an incoming thunderstorm with risk of areal floods. She doesn&rsquo;t hear it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Three houses down, a software engineer sleeps in his bed. A scheduled script fires silently on his home server. A flurry of web crawlers begin recursively scraping web pages, scanning coupon aggregation websites for deals on ceramic planters. A dozen <code>Promises</code> resolve, and the script hurriedly transforms all the API responses into JSON Schema-compliant data blobs, ready for consumption. A weather API indicates an incoming thunderstorm, and the script&rsquo;s execution path veers down an <code>else</code> clause he had written last April during a particularly rainy week. All of his Trello cards tagged with the label <code>Outdoors</code> are postponed by 1 week and re-shuffled to next week. The script resolves, as a nearby coffee pot begins to burble from a now-empty reservoir. His phone alarm fires, and he turns in his bed.</p>
<hr>
<p>She smiles.</p>
<p>He frowns.</p>
