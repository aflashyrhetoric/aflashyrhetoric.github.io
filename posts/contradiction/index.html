<h1 id="contradiction">Contradiction</h1>

<p>I find in myself a contradiction that is seemingly impossible to resolve. Well, actually, it&rsquo;s quite straightforward. But the conclusion <em>feels</em> incomplete, though I know it not to be.
The contradiction is this: if I&rsquo;ve learned nothing, it is the finitude of self. We graduated from an era at the invention of the computer - it was the day we escaped, in a meaningful way, our finitude. We managed to reduce and translate all manner of tasks to a calculated flickering of bits, and bent the electron to our will.</p>

<p>By our interactions with the computer, we became better at the art of <em>optimization</em>, even going so far as to publish articles on over-optimization and premature optimization.</p>

<p>And yet, we - beings of flesh - are so inferior.</p>

<p>And as I continue to develop, I notice this more and more. Though it is, of course, to a lesser extent than those great minds of the past, I find myself bound by my peers. Or - more accurately - by my perception of how I will be received by my peers if I were to show my true self.</p>

<p>I know now that I am not a genius. If there are aspects of genius in me, it is due largely to the blessings of life that have afforded me the time to work on myself, on my mind - the time to work toward solving greater puzzles.</p>

<p>And yet - that is wholly irrelevant - isn&rsquo;t it? I am irrelevant in this matter, genius or fool, I am irrelevant. What matters is the work. And the work is not getting done because of my peers.</p>

<p>And so the ugly question, abstracted, rises again, as it has so often before: &ldquo;which is the nobler goal, happiness now or happiness later?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, the vice grip, again the feeling of suffocating finitude wraps its wiry fingers around my throat. To trade pleasures now for greater pleasures later - this is a</p>
