      <description>This is part 1 of an introductory series on web development tooling. If you&amp;rsquo;re not a developer, this post will be ludicrously boring to you. 
Zoom back to 2012. I&amp;rsquo;m in my dorm room trying to learn Ruby on Rails. Everything is going smoothly! Rails seems magical - perhaps a bit too much. I try to add a feature or two, and my progress comes to a screeching halt.</description>

While the barriers to web development are substantially lower than many other fields, there&amp;rsquo;s still a bunch of junk that makes it frustrating for beginners to jump in.
By &amp;ldquo;obstacles,&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the inherent difficulty in learning a new field, nor the complexity of advanced web development topics.</description>

      <title>Coding Is Not That Hard</title>

      <description>Within the past two years, about a dozen people told me they’re extremely interested in learning how to code. Today, none of them are programmers, developers, or even hobby coders. Most of them, as far as I know, have never even opened a text editor.
The conversation always goes the same way. They want to learn, they have ideas, but it’s all too hard. One of my more determined friends — an art major — admired the idea of focusing on a single project all day, but he would routinely shudder at the sight of actual code.</description>

      <description>This post was written back when Adelie was openly accepting new inquiries and projects.
There are times when the difference between two choices is completely lateral — two substitutable alternatives that are equal in importance and consequence. If you’re craving some fruit, it doesn’t matter whether you choose the apple or the orange. In these instances, it’s okay to defer to preference, precedent, or a coin toss. But these cases are the (rare) exception, not the rule.</description>

      <description>Today, I got the awesome opportunity to represent one of Nulab&amp;rsquo;s apps, Typetalk.
I donned my Nulab tee and hoodie, strapped on the goldenrod &amp;ldquo;Tech Day Exhibitor&amp;rdquo; bracelet, and walked into the sprawling space. At first, I saw the big names - AWS, American Airlines, Vimeo. I continued to the rear end of the space, where we had a table. Japanese candies, t-shirts &amp;amp; totes, business cards, iPads, Macbook Pros with our apps on full-screen - we&amp;rsquo;re ready.</description>

I once heard two friends arguing. One of them had recently come upon a windfall of cash, and wanted to make a big purchase: an upscale sports car. Upon hearing this, his miserly friend fired back, “you don’t even go places! Don’t buy a Porsche to drive to 711.”
When I heard this biting exchange, I chuckled.</description>

In 2005, psychologist Barry Schwartz took the stage at TEDGlobal in Oxford and proposed an idea: that “more is less.” You can watch the full video here, but the core idea is simple. To quote Schwartz, “With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.” He tells a simple anecdote to that effect: many years ago, when he walked into a clothing store, there were only a few pairs of jeans to choose from.</description>
