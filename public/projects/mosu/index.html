<p>Mosu arose out of my personal frustration with the process of job hunting. There are something like a dozen different &ldquo;job board&rdquo; websites, each with their own quirks. I found myself running around between ten different accounts, trying to remember which job applications were in which &ldquo;state&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saved, or &ldquo;To Be Applied To&rdquo;</li>
<li>Application sent</li>
<li>Currently interviewing</li>
<li>Successfully received an offer</li>
</ul>

<p>It was exhausting. I decided to build a tool for myself to manage the chaos, since I figured the job search would last at least a few months.</p>

<p>I tuckered down with some coffee and used Laravel to build a back-end API for a user system, as well as a basic CRUD applicatblah blah blahion for saving &ldquo;job applications.&rdquo; ReactJS was used on the front-end to display data and allow users to manage their job applications, keeping track of information like salary, location (of the position), whether it was a remote position, URLs to the job posting online, and the state of the application.</p>

<p>It worked, and I used it personally to a great degree!</p>

<p>I have since taken down the application (which used to reside at <a href="https://mosu.io">Mosu.io</a>) to work on a proper version 1.0. I have plans to add features like saving personal data, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>biographies (long bios, short bios, summaries)</li>
<li>resumes</li>
<li>objectives (&ldquo;I am a ____ seeking a ____ in NYC.&ldquo;)</li>
<li>blah blah blah</li>
</ul>

<p>I also think it would be great to have an Aggregate View of various job postings, but this would be extremely complicated so I&rsquo;m putting a pin in it.</p>
