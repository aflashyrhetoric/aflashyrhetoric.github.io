      <description>Savor the winter bite,
Though it stiffens your fingers to uselessness,
Though as shards of glass, it moves to
Pierce and flay you bare to bone
Just to remind you again
That you are not welcome here
Savor it regardless; for it will
Recommend you in the end, and testify on your behalf:
He was cold so they could be warm
Savor the exile,
As their aspersions echo in triplicate,</description>
