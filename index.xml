      <description>This is part 1 of an introductory series on web development tooling. 
Series Introduction While the barriers to web development are substantially lower than many other fields, there&amp;rsquo;s still a bunch of junk that makes it frustrating for beginners to jump in.
By &amp;ldquo;obstacles,&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the inherent difficulty in learning a new field, nor the complexity of advanced web development topics. I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the snags that slow progress without benefit.</description>

      <description>Beer me, Slackbot! üç∫ The Adelie Developer&amp;rsquo;s Group is an online, Slack-based study group for web development with around 30 members (as of May &amp;lsquo;17).
The group is beginner-friendly and project-oriented. Currently, some of the members are working on individual developer portfolio websites using modern front-end tooling and best practices.
The roster for project one can be found here.
We use Slack, HackMD, Github, CodePen, YouTube, and other collaborative tools to communicate, share design inspiration, tips, coding help and feedback, and more.</description>

      <title>Coding Is Not That Hard</title>

      <description>Within the past two years, about a dozen people told me they‚Äôre extremely interested in learning how to code. Today, none of them are programmers, developers, or even hobby coders. Most of them, as far as I know, have never even opened a text editor.
The conversation always goes the same way. They want to learn, they have ideas, but it‚Äôs all too hard. One of my more determined friends‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan art major‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääadmired the idea of focusing on a single project all day, but he would routinely shudder at the sight of actual code.</description>

There are times when the difference between two choices is completely lateral‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätwo substitutable alternatives that are equal in importance and consequence. If you‚Äôre craving some fruit, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you choose the apple or the orange. In these instances, it‚Äôs okay to defer to preference, precedent, or a coin toss. But these cases are the (rare) exception, not the rule.</description>

      <description>Milton &amp;amp; Candle The &amp;ldquo;Milton Bros&amp;rdquo; project was my first soiree into the world of character design! I&amp;rsquo;ve always had ambitions to develop a game - I think it&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate form of expression - and while I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat comfortable in learning the development side of things, creating game art was always an extremely foreign world.
I designed Milton (pictured) and &amp;ldquo;Candle&amp;rdquo;, among several other bizarre characters, as a way to dive right into experimenting with simple shapes to build memorable characters.</description>

      <description>LinkedIn, Hired, Vettery, Indeed, Monster&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;üôÖ Mosu arose out of my personal frustration with the process of job hunting. There are something like a dozen different &amp;ldquo;job board&amp;rdquo; websites, each with their own quirks. I found myself running around between ten different accounts, trying to remember which job applications were in which &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo;:

      <description>Ow, my eyes üëÄ Messenger.com is a relatively little-known messaging interface for Facebook Messenger. It&amp;rsquo;s a great (and less power-hungry) alternative to the little chat window you get as part of the standard Facebook desktop experience.
I&amp;rsquo;d often work late in the night, and found that using Messenger.com would hurt my eyes. I had somewhat recently discovered the world of Chrome extension development, so I decided to dive in and see if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make a darker theme for Messenger.</description>

I once heard two friends arguing. One of them had recently come upon a windfall of cash, and wanted to make a big purchase: an upscale sports car. Upon hearing this, his miserly friend fired back, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even go places! Don‚Äôt buy a Porsche to drive to 711.‚Äù
When I heard this biting exchange, I chuckled.</description>

In 2005, psychologist Barry Schwartz took the stage at TEDGlobal in Oxford and proposed an idea: that ‚Äúmore is less.‚Äù You can watch the full video here, but the core idea is simple. To quote Schwartz, ‚ÄúWith so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.‚Äù He tells a simple anecdote to that effect: many years ago, when he walked into a clothing store, there were only a few pairs of jeans to choose from.</description>
