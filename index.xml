      <description>An elderly woman wakes up at 7AM on a brisk Saturday morning. She picks up a bucket of white paint - an impulse buy from a week prior at a local Sherwin-Williams. Grabbing a brush and a tattered rag, she walks to the backyard.
She lives in the lower level of a duplex, so the backyard is hers. Lining the perimeter is an old fence - rusty streaks snake downward from every unsealed joint and the sight casts a macabre pallor over the space.</description>

      <description>In this one TED talk, Malcolm Gladwell told a story about how the U.S. military once spent $3 billion dollars developing a &amp;ldquo;scope&amp;rdquo; (as in, a telescopic sight for a weapon) for planes to attack their targets with terrifying accuracy. When it worked, it was considered revolutionary. The so-called Norden Bombsight made it possible to &amp;ldquo;drop bombs into a pickle barrel from 20,000 feet.&amp;rdquo; God-like accuracy for the time.
However - Gladwell later laments that regardless of the US Military&amp;rsquo;s newfound technical capability, it led to little actual progress because:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within the past two years, about a dozen people told me they‚Äôre extremely interested in learning how to code. Today, &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of them are programmers, developers, or even hobby coders. Most of them, as far as I know, have never even opened a text editor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>üö® A Note  This group has long ago stopped being a resource for newer developers to share tips and support; it is now just a group of colleagues staying in touch. üòÑ  Beer me, Slackbot! üç∫ The Adelie Developer&amp;rsquo;s Group was an online, Slack-based study group for web development.
The group is beginner-friendly and project-oriented. Currently, some of the members are working on individual developer portfolio websites using modern front-end tooling and best practices.</description>

      <description>This post was written back when Adelie was openly accepting new inquiries and projects. There are times when the difference between two choices is completely lateral‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätwo substitutable alternatives that are equal in importance and consequence. If you‚Äôre craving some fruit, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you choose the apple or the orange. In these instances, it‚Äôs okay to defer to preference, precedent, or a coin toss. But these cases are the (rare) exception, not the rule.</description>

      <description>Milton &amp;amp; Candle The &amp;ldquo;Milton Bros&amp;rdquo; project was my first soiree into the world of character design. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had ambitions to develop a game - I think it&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate form of expression - and while I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat comfortable in learning the development side of things, creating game art was always an extremely foreign world.
I designed Milton (pictured) and &amp;ldquo;Candle&amp;rdquo;, among several other bizarre characters, as a way to dive right into experimenting with simple shapes to build memorable characters.</description>

      <description>Ow, my eyes üëÄ Messenger.com is a relatively little-known messaging interface for Facebook Messenger. It&amp;rsquo;s a great (and less power-hungry) alternative to the little chat window you get as part of the standard Facebook desktop experience.
I&amp;rsquo;d often work late in the night, and found that using Messenger.com would hurt my eyes. I had somewhat recently discovered the world of Chrome extension development, so I decided to dive in and see if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make a darker theme for Messenger.</description>

      <description>Savor the winter bite,
Though it stiffens your fingers to uselessness,
Though as shards of glass, it moves to
Pierce and flay you bare to bone
Just to remind you again
That you are not welcome here
Savor it regardless; for it will
Recommend you in the end, and testify on your behalf:
He was cold so they could be warm
Savor the exile,
As their aspersions echo in triplicate,</description>

      <description>This post was written back when Adelie was openly accepting new inquiries and projects. I once heard two friends arguing. One of them had recently come upon a windfall of cash, and wanted to make a big purchase: an upscale sports car. Upon hearing this, his miserly friend fired back, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even go places! Don‚Äôt buy a Porsche to drive to 711.‚Äù
When I heard this biting exchange, I chuckled.</description>

      <description>This post was written back when Adelie was openly accepting new inquiries and projects. In 2005, psychologist Barry Schwartz took the stage at TEDGlobal in Oxford and proposed an idea: that ‚Äúmore is less.‚Äù You can watch the full video here, but the core idea is simple. To quote Schwartz, ‚ÄúWith so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.‚Äù He tells a simple anecdote to that effect: many years ago, when he walked into a clothing store, there were only a few pairs of jeans to choose from.</description>
