      <h2 id="track-debts-between-roommates">Track debts between roommates</h2>
<p>Anyone whose lived in a dorm or an apartment knows that debts can pile up fast between roommates. And they're not always neat little sums of $10.</p>
<p>After a few pizza nights, a round of beers, 5 months of rent and utilities, and so on, remembering &ldquo;who owes who how much&rdquo; is pretty much a hopeless pipe dream.</p>
<p>A spreadsheet can keep track of everything, but somebody has to be the unlucky one tracking all the receipts.</p>
<h4 id="theres-a-better-way-we-have-the-technology">There's a better way. We have the technology.</h4>
<p>Enter: Pay Up! It's 100% intended to be a &ldquo;use it and forget it&rdquo; tool. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, open PayUp and make an account.</li>
<li>Do a one-time configuration: how many roommates are there in your place?</li>
<li>Buy some stuff. Keep your receipts!</li>
<li>Open Pay Up, and enter the total cost.</li>
<li>If everything is going to be split evenly, then you're done! All debts will be split amongst everyone evenly and the purchaser (the one who paid) will get their fair share.</li>
<li>Otherwise, you can select specific items from your receipt to have a custom split. John isn't going to be using the <strong>makeup</strong>? Easy - remove him from the <strong>makeup</strong> item and the cost will be split evenly amongst the others.</li>
<li>At the end of the month - or whenever you prefer - settle your debts with Venmo! (Or Zelle, for larger payments).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="there-are-other-planned-features-in-development-like">There are other planned features in development, like:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to take a photo of the receipt to easily customize items and extract totals</li>
<li>Improved UI to customize purchases either additively or subtractively for faster entry</li>
</ul>
<p>More news to come!</p>
