<p><a href="https://mosu.io">Mosu</a> (NOW RETIRED) arose out of my personal frustration with the process of job hunting. There are something like a dozen different &ldquo;job board&rdquo; websites, each with their own quirks. I found myself running around between ten different accounts, trying to remember which job applications were in which &ldquo;state&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saved, or &ldquo;To Be Applied To&rdquo;</li>
<li>Application sent</li>
<li>Currently interviewing</li>
<li>Successfully received an offer</li>
</ul>
<p>The experience was complete üí© . I decided to build a tool for myself to manage the chaos, since I figured the job search would last at least a few months.</p>
<p>I sat down with some coffee and planned an organization app. The idea was that each <strong>Job Application</strong> goes through a pipeline, compromised of the 4 &ldquo;states&rdquo; mentioned above.</p>
<p>I used Laravel to build a back-end API for a user system, as well as a basic CRUD application for saving &ldquo;job applications.&rdquo; ReactJS was used on the front-end to display data and allow users to manage their job applications, keeping track of information like salary, location (of the position), whether it was a remote position, URLs to the job posting online, and the state of the application. Color indicators allowed you to see, at a glance, what status a particular job application was in.</p>
<p>I have since taken down the pre-alpha application (which used to reside at <a href="https://mosu.io">Mosu.io</a>) to work on a proper alpha version. With some simple promotion, I managed to acquire around 20 semi-regular users, who, after about a year, stopped using the app - hopefully they got a job!</p>
<h2 id="planned-features">Planned Features</h2>
<p>Several features are planned for v1.0, which is (completely arbitrarily) slated for release at the end of year 2018.</p>
<h4 id="integration-with-linkedin-">Integration with LinkedIn ::</h4>
<p>LinkedIn is the de-facto &ldquo;home base&rdquo; for job-seekers. LinkedIn integration would allow for simple sign up and login, and the ability to pull any existing data you may have.</p>
<h4 id="saving-documents">Saving Documents</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m not out to create another Dropbox, but some basic file storage might come in handy for things like resumes.</p>
<h4 id="aggregate-job-board">Aggregate Job Board</h4>
<p>Different job boards have different job listings. Viewing them in one place could come in very, very handy.</p>
<h4 id="live-apply-chrome-extension">&ldquo;Live Apply&rdquo; Chrome Extension</h4>
<p>Each &ldquo;job board&rdquo; site requires different pieces of information. Some require a &ldquo;long bio&rdquo; while others prohibit biographies that are longer than 200 words or so.</p>
<p>Write your content all in one place, and visit a job listing. The Chrome extension can detect your current website and show only the relevant information.</p>
