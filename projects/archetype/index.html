    <div class="project-single__about-text">
      <p>All these product curation websites lately are just - &ldquo;Top 10 Products For Working Professionals,&rdquo; without any insight provided as to <em>how</em> those products - and more vitally, their combination - confer real value to its users. Products don&rsquo;t exist in vacuums, they sit next to each other on your workspace.</p>
<p>Archetype is at once a financial and cultural experiment, built with the intent to stop this thinly-veiled, indiscriminate rehashing of the same hundred-odd products, over and over.</p>
<p>Real curation takes time, it&rsquo;s slow and methodical. Even within a single archetype, there is a combinatorial explosion of factors. You have serious developers, fitness-enthusiast developers, brutalist developers, on-the-go developers, near-sighted developers. Same for designers, accountants, doctors, musicians, therapists.</p>
<p>The experiment is thus: can an affiliate marketing website built with the goal of thoughtful curation and honest feedback still become a profitable endeavor today? Or is it really about virality and click-farming?</p>
<p>There are a lot of questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there enough to cover about the interplay <em>between products</em> to differentiate a site like this?</li>
<li>Can a much slower content release cycle still hold people&rsquo;s attentions, when a guiding value for the blog is to <em>not</em> manufacture opinions and <em>not</em> focus unilaterally on what&rsquo;s trendy?</li>
<li>Moreover, is there even really such a thing as a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; setup for different kinds of work, or is this entire site based on a false premise? Is perhaps a basic monitor and laptop good enough for 95% of people?</li>
</ul>
<p>In development.</p>
