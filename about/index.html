        <h1>BIO</h1>
        <p><span class="about-intro">Hey, I&#39;m Kevin Oh.</span> Currently on sabbatical to be with family, focus on a few side projects, and work on content. More TBD.</p>
<p>Previously, I was working as a <em>Front-End Engineer</em> with the awesome team at <a href="https://www.homelighthomeloans.com">HomeLight: Home Loans</a> working on our collective mission to make real estate transactions <em>simple, certain, and satisfying.</em> üè†. Before that, I worked with the excellent team at <a href="https://nulab.com/">Nulab</a> üíª.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently building <a href="../projects/archetype">Archetype</a>, a place to get curated product recommendations. I&rsquo;m also working on <a href="../projects/keys">Keys</a>, a configurator tool for mechanical keyboards - to help enthusiasts browse products and create shareable builds while also serving to demystify things for beginners. I&rsquo;m also tinkering with a Raspberry Pi to automate the boring stuff.</p>
<p>A while ago, I built a Chrome extension called <a href="../projects/nightmessenger">NightMessenger</a> that peaked at 30,000 DAU before some breaking changes led to the decision to sunset the project. Before that, I had co-founded <a href="https://adelie.co"><strong>Adelie</strong></a>, a web development shop that has since rolled back client-based operations to focus on building internal services &amp; open source projects.</p>
<p>On the side, I also help out as a mod over at <a href="https://reddit.com/r/webdev"><strong>/r/webdev</strong></a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/webdesign"><strong>/r/webdesign</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p><strong>Whatcha workin on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read about my projects <a href="../projects"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What technologies are you studying?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been diving into the deeper end of TypeScript. Post on that Soon. ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Or maybe not. Who knows.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m also currently studying:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://go.dev/"><strong>Go</strong></a>, for use in Appledore, a personal relationships manager I&rsquo;m working on building,</li>
<li><a href="https://laravel.com/"><strong>Laravel</strong></a>, for use in <a href="../projects/keys">Keys</a>, a configurator tool for mechanical keyboards (among other things)</li>
<li><a href="https://strapi.io/"><strong>Strapi</strong></a>, for incredibly rapid back-end scaffolding for content-centric sites</li>
<li><a href="https://www.blender.org/"><strong>Blender</strong></a>, for 3D animations and visuals, with particular interest about potential exports to WebGL/similar</li>
<li><a href="https://godotengine.org/"><strong>Godot</strong></a>, for <strong>game development</strong>. I recently made an iOS recreation of an old mini-game from the video game Jak 2, and it was far more intuitive than I thought it&rsquo;d be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someday, I&rsquo;d like to learn more about: TensorFlow &amp; ML, D3, K8, and blob fishes.</p>

<h2 id="preferred-tools--tech">Preferred Tools &amp; Tech</h2>
<p>I use VSCode Insider Edition, Chrome, and iTerm2. I prefer working on an 2021 M1 Max MacBook Pro. The Keychron C1 is a fantastic device for the price.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shout-out to my parents, Kelly Ï∂òÏã§ Kim and Ïò§Î™ÖÎÇ®. You taught me patience, tact, persistence, wisdom, and selflessness. Shout-out to the awesome, ambitious people at the Adelie Developer&rsquo;s Group, the subreddit moderation teams, HLHL and Nulab. I&rsquo;m better for having met every one of y&rsquo;all. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
