Mosu arose out of my personal frustration with the process of job hunting. There are something like a dozen different "job board" websites, each with their own quirks. I found myself running around between ten different accounts, trying to remember which jobs were in which state:

- Saved, or "To Be Applied To"
- Application sent
- Currently interviewing
- Successfully received an offer
