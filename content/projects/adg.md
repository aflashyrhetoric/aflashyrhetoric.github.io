#### :rotating_light: A Note
- This group has long ago stopped being a resource for newer developers to share tips and support; it is now just a group of colleagues staying in touch. :smile:

#### Beer me, Slackbot! :beer:

The Adelie Developer's Group was an online, Slack-based study group for web development.

The group is beginner-friendly and project-oriented. Currently, some of the members are working on individual developer portfolio websites using modern front-end tooling and best practices. 

### Group Information & Resources

We use Slack, HackMD, Github, CodePen, YouTube, and other collaborative tools to communicate, share design inspiration, tips, coding help and feedback, and more.

Currently, slots are closed to keep the community small, but inactive members are routinely removed, so you can join the waiting list by [emailing me at kevin@adelie.co](mailto:kevin@adelie.co). Thanks!
