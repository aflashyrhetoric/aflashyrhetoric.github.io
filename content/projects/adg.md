#### Beer me, Slackbot! :beer:

The Adelie Developer's Group is an online, Slack-based study group for web development with around 30 members (as of May '17). 

The group is beginner-friendly and project-oriented. Currently, some of the members are working on individual developer portfolio websites using modern front-end tooling and best practices. 

The roster for project one can be found [here](http://notes.adelie.co/s/S1A1crdpg).

We use Slack, HackMD, Github, CodePen, YouTube, and other collaborative tools to communicate, share design inspiration, tips, coding help and feedback, and more.

Currently, slots are closed to keep the community small, but extremely inactive members are routinely removed, so you can join the waiting list by [emailing me at aflashyrhetoric@gmail.com](mailto:aflashyrhetoric@gmail.com). Thanks!
