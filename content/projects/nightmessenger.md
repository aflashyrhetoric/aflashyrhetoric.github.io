#### Ow, my eyes :eyes:

Messenger.com is a relatively little-known messaging interface for Facebook Messenger. It's a great (and less power-hungry) alternative to the little chat window you get as part of the standard Facebook desktop experience.

I'd often work late in the night, and found that using Messenger.com would hurt my eyes. I had somewhat recently discovered the world of Chrome extension development, so I decided to dive in and see if I couldn't make a darker theme for Messenger.com. 

It went smoother than I expected. Google provided an easy way for an extension to add stylesheets and cloud-setting-sync abilities. The concept of a `manifest.json` was similar to a `package.json` file, and the UI for the "Developer Dashboard" was really intuitive - if a little basic. :wink:

You can [download Night Messenger here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/night-messenger/hjhnmilbfdehpgfcojlmmooknnkhgdmh?hl=en). It currently has 4,000+ users, and the most recent version (v1.2.5) introduced properly-limited permissions and can be considered **stable**.

Let me know if you have feedback or feature requests. Cheers :beer:!
