Mosu arose out of my personal frustration with the process of job hunting. There are something like a dozen different "job board" websites, each with their own quirks. I found myself running around between ten different accounts, trying to remember which job applications were in which "state":

- Saved, or "To Be Applied To"
- Application sent
- Currently interviewing
- Successfully received an offer

It was exhausting. I decided to build a tool for myself to manage the chaos, since I figured the job search would last at least a few months.

I tuckered down with some coffee and used Laravel to build a back-end API for a user system, as well as a basic CRUD applicatblah blah blahion for saving "job applications." ReactJS was used on the front-end to display data and allow users to manage their job applications, keeping track of information like salary, location (of the position), whether it was a remote position, URLs to the job posting online, and the state of the application.

It worked, and I used it personally to a great degree! 

I have since taken down the application (which used to reside at [Mosu.io](https://mosu.io)) to work on a proper version 1.0. I have plans to add features like saving personal data, such as:

- biographies (long bios, short bios, summaries)
- resumes
- objectives ("I am a ____ seeking a ____ in NYC.")
- blah blah blah

I also think it would be great to have an Aggregate View of various job postings, but this would be extremely complicated so I'm putting a pin in it.
