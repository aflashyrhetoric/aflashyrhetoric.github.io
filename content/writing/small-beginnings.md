Savor the winter bite,\
Though it stiffens your fingers to uselessness,
Though as shards of glass, it moves to
Pierce and flay you bare to bone
Just to remind you again that you are not welcome here
Savor it regardless; For it will
Recommend you in the end, and testify on your behalf:
He was cold so they could be warm

Savor the exile,
Though their aspersions echo in triplicate,
Unified - a confident chorus denouncing the core of you
Even the diplomats among them would not tread in
The winding valley you've called home
They would wither without their sun -
For as sure as they are warm, they are blind,
And know nothing of the weapons of the dark

Savor the songbird's song
On the days you hear it, do not deny you've heard it,
And sing it over in your heart; the song bird
Who flies over valley and peak all the same,
Is part of a timeless order of angels
And will cover you as you explore the Gray
