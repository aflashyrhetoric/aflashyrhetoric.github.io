{{<span class="about-intro" content="Hey, I'm Kevin Oh." >}} Currently on sabbatical to be with family, focus on a few side projects, and work on content. More TBD.

Previously, I was working as a _Front-End Engineer_ with the awesome team at [HomeLight: Home Loans](https://www.homelighthomeloans.com) working on our collective mission to make real estate transactions _simple, certain, and satisfying._ :house:. Before that, I worked with the excellent team at [Nulab](https://nulab.com/) :laptop:.

I'm currently building [Archetype](/projects/archetype), a place to get curated product recommendations. I'm also working on [Keys](/projects/keys), a configurator tool for mechanical keyboards - to help enthusiasts browse products and create shareable builds while also serving to demystify things for beginners. I'm also tinkering with a Raspberry Pi to automate the boring stuff.

A while ago, I built a Chrome extension called [NightMessenger](/projects/nightmessenger) that peaked at 30,000 DAU before some breaking changes led to the decision to sunset the project. Before that, I had co-founded [**Adelie**](https://adelie.co), a web development shop that has since rolled back client-based operations to focus on building internal services & open source projects.

On the side, I also help out as a mod over at [**/r/webdev**](https://reddit.com/r/webdev) and [**/r/webdesign**](https://reddit.com/r/webdesign).

## Q&A

**Whatcha workin on?**

- Read about my projects [**here**](/projects).

**What technologies are you studying?**

I've been diving into the deeper end of TypeScript. Post on that Soon. :tm: Or maybe not. Who knows.

**I'm also currently studying:**

- [**Go**](https://go.dev/), for use in Appledore, a personal relationships manager I'm working on building,
- [**Laravel**](https://laravel.com/), for use in [Keys](/projects/keys), a configurator tool for mechanical keyboards (among other things)
- [**Strapi**](https://strapi.io/), for incredibly rapid back-end scaffolding for content-centric sites
- [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/), for 3D animations and visuals, with particular interest about potential exports to WebGL/similar
- [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/), for **game development**. I recently made an iOS recreation of an old mini-game from the video game Jak 2, and it was far more intuitive than I thought it'd be.

Someday, I'd like to learn more about: TensorFlow & ML, D3, K8, and blob fishes.

## Preferred Tools & Tech

I use VSCode Insider Edition, Chrome, and iTerm2. I prefer working on an 2021 M1 Max MacBook Pro. The Keychron C1 is a fantastic device for the price.

Shout-out to my parents, Kelly 춘실 Kim and 오명남. You taught me patience, tact, persistence, wisdom, and selflessness. Shout-out to the awesome, ambitious people at the Adelie Developer's Group, the subreddit moderation teams, HLHL and Nulab. I'm better for having met every one of y'all. :heart:
