### My name is Kevin 성현 Oh 

Or, *[@aflashyrhetoric](http://twitter.com/aflashyrhetoric)*.

I'm a front-end developer based in New York. Currently working as a *Front-End Engineer* with the excellent team at Nulab. I lead a Slack-based [study group](/projects/adg) that aims to help its members grow as developers through both casual and rigorous discussion, code challenges, and more. I co-founded Adelie, an open source software collective that currently offers - ahem - zero available products. But don't worry, I'm working on it. :cat:

On the side, I also serve as a mod over at [/r/webdev](https://reddit.com/r/webdev).

#### Projects?

Read about my projects [HERE](/projects).

#### What technologies are you studying?

I'm currently working with Vue and Golang, primarily. I'm also studying Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker & container technology, SQL, and systems design.

#### Outside interests?

I'm a hobbyist writer & blogger.

**I'm also currently studying:**

- **Japanese**, so that I can talk to my Japanese coworkers
- **music production with Ableton Live**, because it's a childhood dream to make a great song
- **game design**, because it's the ultimate medium of expression
- **photography**, because life's too beautiful not to capture
- **video editing / screencasting**, to create helpful webdev-related content
- **web scraping** to glean huge amounts of data

Someday, I'd like to learn more about: TensorFlow, machine learning, the stock market, special relativity, StarCraft 2, blob fishes.

#### Preferred Tools & Tech

I use Sublime Text & Visual Studio Code, both with vim keybindings. Chrome, iTerm2, Webpack, blah blah. 

Golang and Vue are my recent tools of choice, although in the past I used primarily Laravel + React.

#### Random Fun Facts
- Currently reading Infinite Jest, David & Goliath, The Girl w/ The Dragon Tattoo.
- My cat Bernie is a fat demon and his little baby brother has claws sharper than Wolverine
- My favorite non-fiction author is Malcolm Gladwell
- Our president is illiterate
- I detest almonds and you should do because yes they're healthy but let's face it, they taste like brick if brick was edible and that sickly aftertaste is out of this world, not in a good way, like in an alien way because the flavor is so foreign and hard to tolerate
