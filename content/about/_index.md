{{< span class="about-intro" content="Hey, I'm Kevin Oh." >}} Currently working as a *Front-End Engineer* with the team at [HomeLight](https://homelight.com). Previously, I worked with the excellent team at Nulab. I built a Chrome extension called [NightMessenger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/night-messenger/hjhnmilbfdehpgfcojlmmooknnkhgdmh?hl=en), a CLI tool to complement the PM tool [Backlog](https://backlog.com), and lead a Slack-based [study group](/projects/adg) that focuses on building projects to gain practical experience with modern web development technologies. 

I co-founded Adelie, a web development shop that has since rolled back client-based operations to focus on building internal services & open source projects.

On the side, I also serve as a mod over at [/r/webdev](https://reddit.com/r/webdev) and [/r/webdesign](https://reddit.com/r/webdesign).

#### Projects?

Read about my projects [HERE](/projects).

#### What technologies are you studying?

I'm currently working with React w/ Redux and Go on various projects.

#### Outside interests?

I like writing. I also upload stuff to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/adelieco) sometimes.

**I'm also currently studying:**

- **video editing / screencasting**, to create helpful webdev-related YouTube content
- **music production (w/ Ableton Live)**, because it's a childhood dream to make a great song
- **game design**, because I feel like it's the ultimate medium of expression
- **photography**, because life's too beautiful not to capture
- **web scraping** and dataviz, for obvious reasons
- **Japanese**

Someday, I'd like to learn more about: TensorFlow & ML, D3, K8, and blob fishes. I have a heart for education - I think the current system is perhaps 1/50th of what it could be - and one day hope to make a change in the industry.

#### Preferred Tools & Tech

I use VSCode, Chrome, iTerm2 on a MacBook Pro/Air.

- Shout-out to my parents, Kelly 춘실 Kim and 오명남. You taught me patience, true humility, persistence, grace, and selflessness. Shout-out to the awesome, ambitious people at the Adelie Developer's Group. It's been a pleasure meeting all of you. Lastly, to my talented colleagues and Nulab. Working alongside every one of you is a pleasure.
