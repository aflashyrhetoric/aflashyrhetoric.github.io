# My name is Kevin Oh.

Or, *[@aflashyrhetoric](http://twitter.com/aflashyrhetoric)*.

I'm a front-end developer based in New York. Currently working as a *Front-End Engineer* with the excellent team at Nulab. I lead a Slack-based [ study group](/projects/adg) that focuses on building projects to gain practical experience with modern web development technologies. I co-founded Adelie, an open source software collective that currently offers - ahem - zero available products. But don't worry, I'm working on it. :cat:

On the side, I also serve as a mod over at [/r/webdev](https://reddit.com/r/webdev).

#### Projects?

Read about my projects [HERE](/projects).

#### What technologies are you studying?

I'm currently working with Laravel, React, and Vue on various projects.
I'm also studying Amazon Web Services, Jenkins CI, Docker, and systems design.

#### Any outside interests?

Yes! I'm a hobbyist writer & blogger.

**I'm also currently studying:**

- **Japanese**, so that I can talk to my Japanese coworkers
- **music production with Ableton Live**, because it's a childhood dream to make a great song
- **game design**, because I feel like it's the ultimate medium of expression
- **photography**, because life's too beautiful not to capture
- **video editing / screencasting**, to create helpful webdev-related YouTube content

Someday, I'd like to learn more about: TensorFlow, machine learning, the stock market, special relativity, StarCraft 2, blob fishes.

#### Preferred Tools & Tech

I use Sublime Text 3 w/ vim keybindings. Chrome, iTerm2. Laravel + React are my recent tools of choice.

#### Random Fun Facts
- I've cut my own hair for about 3 years now, :dollar:
- My cat Bernie is a fat demon
- My favorite non-fiction author is Malcolm Gladwell
- Our president is illiterate
- I detest almonds and you should do because yes they're healthy but let's face it, they taste like brick if brick was edible and that sickly aftertaste is out of this world, not in a good way, like in an alien way because the flavor is so foreign and hard to tolerate
