# My name is Kevin Oh.

I'm a front-end developer based in New York. Currently working as a *Front-End Engineer* with the excellent team at Nulab. I lead a Slack-based [ study group](/projects/adg) that focuses on building projects to gain practical experience with modern web development technologies. I co-founded Adelie, an open source software collective with zero available products - but don't worry, I'm working on it. 

Whether it's with Javascript or English, I want to change the world.
