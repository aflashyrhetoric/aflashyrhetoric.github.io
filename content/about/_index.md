{{<span class="about-intro" content="Hey, I'm Kevin." >}} Currently working as a _Front-End Engineer_ with the awesome team at [HomeLight: Home Loans](https://www.homelighthomeloans.com) :house:. Previously, I worked with the excellent team at [Nulab](https://nulab.com/) :laptop:.

I'm currently building [Archetype](/projects/archetype), a place to get workflow tips and product recommendations from others who do the work you do. I'm also tinkering with a Raspberry Pi to automate the boring stuff. I built a Chrome extension called [NightMessenger](/projects/nightmessenger) that peaked at 30,000 DAU before some breaking changes led to the decision to sunset the project.

I co-founded [**Adelie**](https://adelie.co), a web development shop that has since rolled back client-based operations to focus on building internal services & open source projects.

On the side, I also serve as a mod over at [**/r/webdev**](https://reddit.com/r/webdev) and [**/r/webdesign**](https://reddit.com/r/webdesign).

#### **Whatcha workin on?**

Read about my projects [**here**](/projects).

#### **What technologies are you studying?**

I've been diving into the deeper end of TypeScript. Post on that Soon. :tm: Or maybe not. Who knows.

**I'm also currently studying:**

- [**Strapi**](https://strapi.io/), for incredibly rapid back-end scaffolding
- [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/), for 3D animations and visuals, with particular interest about potential exports to WebGL/similar 
- **game development** with Godot, with support for exporting to iOS

Someday, I'd like to learn more about: TensorFlow & ML, D3, K8, and blob fishes. I have a heart for education - I think the current system is perhaps 1/50th of what it could be - and one day hope to make a change in the industry.

#### Preferred Tools & Tech

I use VSCode Insider Edition, Chrome, and iTerm2. I prefer working on an 2021 M1 Max MacBook Pro. The Keychron C1 is a fantastic device for the price.

Shout-out to my parents, Kelly 춘실 Kim and 오명남. You taught me patience, tact, persistence, wisdom, and selflessness. Shout-out to the awesome, ambitious people at the Adelie Developer's Group, the subreddit moderation teams, HLHL and Nulab. I'm better for having met every one of y'all. :heart:
