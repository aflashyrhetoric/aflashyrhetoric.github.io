## On "crutches"

The term "crutch" is typically used to refer to something that enables an inexperienced or otherwise incapable person to do something that they could otherwise not do.

In regards to code, I've heard the term being used to defend archaic or, at least, suboptimal practices. Let's talk about that.

I've heard the following being called a "crutch":

- Prettier, the code-formatting tool
- Typescript
- Bootstrap, Foundation, animate.css, [...most CSS libraries]
- `!important`, the CSS override
- `create-react-app`, Yeoman
- Docker
- etc

## Which of these is actually a "crutch"?

I don't think any of them qualify, but I understand the criticism as part of a larger discussion about the nature of our reliance on the tools we use. Drawing specific lines in the sand is an exhaustive and wonderfully under-rewarding exercise, so instead of empathetically tiptoeing within semantic nuance

A tool is only a crutch:
- you use it without understanding how it works
- you use it because without it, you could not do the same thing

It seems the label is applied toward tools whose chief purpose is to make coding _easier_ by taking care of the housework and chores. Prettier cleans your code for you, yeoman scaffolds project structures for you, Bootstrap provides styles for you.
