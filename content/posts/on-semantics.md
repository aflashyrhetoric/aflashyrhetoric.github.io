The day after I turned thirteen, I went to a bookstore and picked up a book called _A Rulebook for Arguments_. Its name was literal - its contents were about how best to _win an argument_ by proposing and defending a thesis, all while steering clear of these intellectual traps that I soon learned were called "_fallacies_." And each one had a name!

When my English teacher publicly ridiculed and dismissed my idea for a passive water-filtration device, yep, that was _ad hominem._<sup>1</sup> When I tried to argue that sandals didn't violate the church dress code on the grounds that Jesus himself had worn sandals, and the teacher responded by saying "No real Christian would come to church in sandals" - ah, that was the _No True Scotsman_. So it goes.

They say that in naming something, we take some of its power. I think I agree, because I felt powerful that day - the day I learned Their Names. In acknowledging violations of a logical standard, we directly acknowledge the existence of the standard itself. And that felt good. Safe. To know that such a standard existed in the world, even if it wasn't perfectly enforced.

In code, when something breaks, a test fails, and pixels flash red. Not the best feeling, but it's helpful. The chaotic soup of human _belief_ is not so absolute. There is no central, indisputable arbiter of truth, there are only references of correctness. A misogynistic tirade would yield red lights with one crowd, green lights with another. But as a kid from a moderate family, from a conservative cultural background, living in a conservative pocket of a liberal state - it's easy to get mixed signals. 



<sup>1</sup> They already exist, by the way, and they're called solar stills.
