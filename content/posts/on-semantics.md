The day after I turned thirteen, I went to a bookstore and picked up a book called _A Rulebook for Arguments_. Its name was literal - its contents were about how best to _win an argument_ by proposing and defending a thesis. I learned about fallacies. I found it interesting that each one had a name. When my former English teacher dismissed my idea for a passive water-filtration device and defended the decision by ridiculing me directly, yep, that was good ol' _ad hominem._<sup>1</sup> At church, when I tried to argue that sandals didn't violate the church dresscode on the grounds that Jesus himself had worn sandals, and the teacher responded by saying "No real Christian would come to church in sandals" - ah, that was the _No True Scotsman_.

They say that in naming something, we take some of its power. I am glad, then, that each fallacy has its own name. In acknowledging violations of a logical standard, we acknowledge and validate the standard itself. And that felt good. Safe. To know that such a standard existed in the world, even if it wasn't perfectly enforced.

I'm not the oldest, smartest or the wisest, but one thing seems to held true since that day I turned thirteen: it's barely enforced at all.

It is easy, to take mental shortcuts.

Fallacious reasoning, with its lower mental cost and ability to emotionally bind people together, has won full-stop.

In code, when something breaks, a test fails, and pixels flash red. Not the best feeling, but it's helpful to have objective, unmotivated, and instant feedback. The chaotic soup of human _belief_ is not so absolute. There is no central, indisputable arbiter of truth, there are only frames, or references, of correctness. A misogynistic tirade would yield red lights with one crowd, green lights with another. As a kid from a moderate family, from a conservative cultural background, living in a conservative pocket of a liberal state - it's easy to get mixed signals.

<sup>1</sup> They already exist, by the way, and they're called solar stills.

I guess some of those tenured fixtures of geriatric suburban mediocrity taught me something after all.
