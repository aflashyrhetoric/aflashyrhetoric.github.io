Walk past the wind burnt veteran
There's that smell again, a gust and it's gone, keep on
Movin on, moving in,
New Ikea frames to frame that thing,
Looks real good, head to Amazon, 
Keep moving on, movin in

I remember when,
Red and blue were nothing more
Than the color of the 3d lenses
Ten years on, came to my senses

Now it's 2017
And the red beat blue 
And the blue makes black bleed red 
And the black falls dead 
And the blue, and the red 
Just count all the green

While the kid at 17
Works one two jobs
Sorry three
Sorry two, 
Job 3 required 3-20 years of experience

Now, One and one is ten
Take me back to when
Things made fucking sense
And the choice wasn't between Satan
And fuckin Michael Pence
They're all one and the same
To them it's a game

Well I just hit start
Player me just joned
