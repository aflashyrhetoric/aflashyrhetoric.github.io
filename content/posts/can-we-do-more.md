In this one TED talk, Malcolm Gladwell told a story about how the U.S. military once spent $3 billion dollars developing a "scope" (as in, _a telescopic sight for a weapon_) for planes to attack their targets with terrifying accuracy. When it worked, it was considered revolutionary. The so-called **Norden Bombsight** made it possible to "drop bombs into a pickle barrel from 20,000 feet." God-like accuracy for the time. 

However - Gladwell later laments that regardless of the US Military's newfound technical capability, it led to little actual progress because "the harder problem [in war] isn't putting the bomb in the pickle barrel, it's finding the pickle barrel in the first place."

The world of programming has always been characterized by a relentless pursuit of improvement and optimization. Any algorithm in the world could be done by a human with a pencil and some paper. The goal is to do it faster, more efficiently. 

But I fear, at least in the scope of my own goals as a developer, that my participation in that grand pursuit has, for too long, gone undirected by some greater moral imperative. Something to give it all meaning. And after years of study, what I've become is a toddler sitting in a Porsche, armed to the teeth with plasma weapons, with no real enemies to shoot and no idea where to go.

I don't mean to dismiss what great minds have accomplished or diminish the ingenuity of their contributions. Their work has paid, little by little, for little time slots that we all enjoy, little pockets of time that have allowed us to turn our eyes toward higher. After all - when's the last time you spent an entire day washing your laundry by hand? Technology has freed us from a lot of boring bullshit. 

And I don't just mean with the manual chores. From our project management methodologies (Agile/Kanban), to our tools (Webpack/Rollup), to our models of cooperation and the software that sustains them (Git Flow / Github / Git), to our naming conventions for scaleability (BEV-M/styleguides/linters), to the abstractions we use to model our data (ORMs), to the...okay see? Even attempting to laundry-list all the tools we use is a laughably futile effort. You get what I'm trying to say. 

It is indisputable that every readily conceivable facet of problem-solving has been boiled down to its barest essences and optimized.

But in my own life, as an individual human being, where does that leave me? Okay, AWS has made cloud computing accessible and affordable, and with containerization technologies like Docker, provisioning tools like Ansible, caches, quick-compiling statically typed languages like Golang, Continouous Deployment & Integration systems like CI/Travis/Jenkins/etc, I (the proverbial _"I"_) can solve problems at scales previously unheard of. For absolute certain - this is nothing to scoff at. It is remarkable and jaw-droppingly amazing what brilliant minds have been able to create. 

And yet, when I see old friendships dissolve on Facebook because of bitter political arguments, when I see the systematic spread of false information, the overwhelming flood of brilliantly-marketed distractions violently spewing out of every digital `.com` orifice of the Internet, when I start to notice patterns in the signs and speeches broadcast by homeless men on the train, when I hear statistics about the jaw-dropping wealth inequality in the country, I feel a sharp sting of frustration.

Surely, if I'm so smart, and surely, if I have access to this great technology, I should be able to *do something*? If I could type the code in just the right way, then in a year's time I could halve world hunger?

I don't mean to contrive and impose a moral impetus on every other developer in the world to go and join a nonprofit. But I can't help but wonder - could I, myself, be doing more? I'm certain I could. Our profession is, at its heart, about problem-solving, but for too long I've confused the labor of optimization with the labor of actually producing _solutions_.

I say again - it feels like I'm armed with a bombsight, with the ability to shoot bombs inside a pickel barrel from 20,000 feet, but with no barrel in sight.

This post is a reminder to _myself_ to re-focus. Remember the power that a simple WordPress site can have. Remember that somewhere out there, thousands of people are doing more with a Wix website than I've ever done with the apps I built using whatever.js.

In the current political and economic landscape in the US, there's a lot to broken stuff to fix. FreeCodeCamp and organizations like Catchafire connect nonprofits with devs. CodeForAmerica connects government with devs.
