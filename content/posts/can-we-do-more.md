## Bombs & Pickle Barrels
 
In a TED talk, Malcolm Gladwell told a story about how the U.S. military once spent $3 billion dollars developing a "scope" (as in,_a telescopic sight for a weapon_) for fighter planes to attack their targets more accurately. When it worked, it was considered revolutionary. _When it worked._ The so-called **Norden Bombsight** made it possible to "drop bombs into a pickle barrel from 20,000 feet." God-like accuracy for the time. Gladwell later notes, though, that regardless of the US Military's newfound technical capability, it led to little actual progress because "the harder problem [in war] isn't putting the bomb in the pickle barrel, it's finding the pickle barrel in the first place."

The world of programming has always been characterized by optimization. In a very real way, that's the whole point. You could calculate your taxes by hand, after all - the point is to leverage technology so you can do it *faster* and *better*.

Faster, better. The former is an objective metric of software we write, but what of the second? What constitutes *better*? I'm not posing a rhetorical abstract - let's explore the semantics. If "better" can be used to describe something that provides greater value than some other thing, the adapted question becomes: "how can we measure value?"

Simply, in this context, we might measure a software's value as the efficacy with which it solves the problem it was built to solve.

So, then, what problems am I solving? I have a few answers, but they are not good ones. They are problems which, when solved, would only provide value in the form of *a slight convenience*. And that does not interest me or give me purpose.

Have I destroyed the pickle barrel, or am I shooting lasers into the dirt, too distracted by the flashing lights to notice that I have missed my target completely? I don't know, man.

For too long, I feel like my studies have gone undirected by some greater moral imperative. Something to give it all meaning, an end toward which I could channel my blind millennial idealism. I feel as though, after years of study, I've become a toddler sitting in a Porsche, armed to the teeth with plasma weapons but with no enemies to shoot and no idea where to go.

From our project management methodologies (Agile/Kanban), to our tools (Webpack/Rollup), to our models of cooperation and the software that sustains them (Git Flow / Github / Git), to our naming conventions for scaleability (BEV-M/styleguides/linters), to the abstractions we use to model our data (ORMs), to the...okay see? Even attempting to laundry-list this is a laughably futile effort. It comes off as a pretentious humble-brag to even try. You get what I'm trying to say. Every conceivable facet of problem-solving has been boiled down (by great minds, I don't mean to be reductive or ungrateful) to its barest essences, and optimized. And optimized and optimized.

But what good is a knife, sharpened to an atomic edge, with nothing to cut? In my own life, as an individual human being, where does that leave me? Okay, AWS has made cloud computing accessible and affordable, and with containerization technologies like Docker, provisioning tools like Ansible, caches and message queues, quick-compiling statically typed languages like Golang, Continouous Deployment & Integration systems like CI/Travis/Jenkins/etc, I can solve problems at scales previously unheard of. 

And yet, when I see:
- old friendships dissolve on Facebook because of bitter political arguments,
- the systematic spread of false information, 
- unceasing streams of brilliantly-marketed distractions violently spewing out of every digital `.com` orifice of the Internet...
- patterns in the signs and speeches broadcast by homeless men
- statistics about the wealth inequality in the country

...I feel a sharp prick of frustration. Because surely, if I'm so smart, and surely, if I have access to this great technology, I should be able to *do something*? If I could type the code in just the right way, then in a year's time I could halve world hunger. Right?

I don't mean to contrive and impose a moral impetus on every other developer in the world to go and join a nonprofit. But I can't help but wonder - could I be doing more? I'm certain I could. Our profession is, at its heart, about problem-solving. In the current political and economic landscape in the US, there's a lot to broken stuff to fix. FreeCodeCamp and organizations like Catchafire connect nonprofits with devs. CodeForAmerica connects government with devs.
