In this one TED talk, Malcolm Gladwell talks about how the military once spent $3 billion dollars developing a "scope" for planes to target and launch their bombs. When it worked, it was considered revolutionary because it made it possible to "drop bombs into a pickle barrel from 20,000 feet." Insane accuracy for the time. He notes later, though, that regardless of the US Military's newfound technical capability, it led to little actual progress because "the harder problem [in war] isn't putting the bomb in the pickle barrel, it's finding the pickle barrel in the first place." 

We have seen, and will continue to see now more than ever before, explosive growth in the future of web development. From the language that powers our back-ends, all the way to the templating languages used on the front-end, we have what seems like a million different ways to stitch together tech. Great minds and the amazing sacrifices of so many developers has empowered the community to insane heights.

But one of the interesting quirks of the times, is that many beginners will still ask: "but what do I build"? "What problem can I solve?" And the answer given is still often: "eh, a todo app." 

It's not that that specific suggestion is problematic. It's not. But it makes me wonder if perhaps we've become so burdened (and enamored) by our tooling that we've tuned out, a bit, of the ways in which we can use our skills to solve *human* problems. The more seasoned devs know that even a basic WordPress site can provide a world of value in the right hands, after all.

I don't mean to contrive and impose a moral impetus on every other developer in the world to go and join a nonprofit. No way. But I can't help but wonder - could we be doing more? I'm certain we could. Not that we should abandon current efforts to improve tech further (I know it's not zero-sum) but I think it would be amazing if we had a way for "the average dev" to help improve social issues the same ay they contribute their time to OSS.

Our profession is, at its heart, about problem-solving. In the current political and economic landscape in the US, there's a lot to fix and a lot to improve on. FreeCodeCamp and organizations like Catchafire connect nonprofits with devs. CodeForAmerica connects government with devs. 


In your eyes, as someone who has a larger network, more connections, a seasoned career, and intimate knowledge of how to apply varying tech stacks to solve different kinds of nuanced problems, what do you think would be the best way for "the average developer" to use his/her skillset to improving the state of society?
