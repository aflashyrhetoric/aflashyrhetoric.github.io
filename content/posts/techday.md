Today, I got the awesome opportunity to represent one of Nulab's apps, Typetalk.

I donned my Nulab tee and hoodie, strapped on the goldenrod "Tech Day Exhibitor" bracelet, and walked into the sprawling space. At first, the big names - AWS, American Airlines, Vimeo. I continued to the rear end of the space, where we had a table set up. Japanese candies, t-shirts & totes, business cards, iPads, Macbook Pros with our apps on full-screen - we're ready.

10AM rolls around and the visitors start coming. Everyone's apprehensive. They inch towards our eye-catching purple backdrop.

> "Hi, we're Nulab! We create collaborative apps for modern teams!"

A few of them nod, grab a t-shirt, then beeline to the next booth. I overhear someone in another booth, "if you come to just one of these a year, you would never have to shop for clothes."

I silently agree, my cynicism peeking its head. My time spent in university businesses classes left me with a revulsion for terms like "weak tie" and "elevator pitch". Loathe as I am to admit it, part of me dreaded this day.

But I was completely wrong! The vast majority of visitors to our table consisted of entrepreneurs, freelancers, and teachers. Ambitious students with a genuine interest in what our apps did and how they were built. Some visitors were happy with their existing solutions - which is great! - but others seemed intrigued by the way our apps worked to solve some of the traditional problems companies face regarding communication, project management, and more!

I don't want this blog post to sound overly promotional, so I'll leave it at that, but truly, it was a great feeling to know that I was part of a team that creates tools that makes work more efficient, focused, and even fun.
