## Utopia 

> The surest way to win a war is to convince your enemy that there's no war at all.

It's a truism to say that the world is not as it should be.

But it's my belief that we've collectively lost sight of just how grotesquely imbalanced things actually are. 

It's not *just* that we're ignorant. There are those who know, but have lost hope. There are those who cannot afford to care because they're burnt to exhaustion while trying to stay afloat. Some just don't give a shit.

And then there are those select few that *know* and gleefully perpetuate the imbalance. The ones who are ecstatic that you don't know, that you don't care, that you're hopeless.

I am not here to recruit you to a cause or to perpetuate an ideology. I aim to give you a set of facts and then ask you a series of questions so you can draw your own conclusions. My hope is that by the end of all this, one of two things will come to pass:

Either, I will understand what the fuck is going on - or *you* will. Because one of us is behaving insanely - in a way that makes no real sense.

First, a grand question to guide all other questions: "Are we at an acceptable place in society?"

If you've any ambition or empathy at all, the answer is no. Unless you're one of the exorbitantly wealthy people whose social circles entirely exclude people of the middle and lower classes, it's safe to say that either you or someone you know is suffering.

Alright, so we're not in a Utopia. Next question:

Are we making progress, though? Are we getting closer to some ideal?

I think yes. There are politicians, charities, individuals, and institutions that are actively and strategically trying to improve the state of society. We're making progress.

Now, my third and last question for now: Are we making progress *fast enough*? Enough to offset the damage that is being consistently doled out?

I think, no. Hell no. Absolutely not. I see the world in flames and am confounded as to how this came to be.

Let me preface it all with a final aside: For a time, I dismissed my own thoughts before someone else could. Before you could. I didn't want to be the conspiracy theorist with the tin hat. But my assertion is this. If you read this text with the sole exclusive goal of seeking the unfiltered truth, you'll want a tin hat too. And you'll be angry. I don't mean just pissed off, like when a possum knocks over the trash or someone chews loudly at the other table. I'm talking about the kind of anger that sends blood coursing through your biceps because your body is commanding you to act. To **do** something. The only kind of anger that is immune to time is the one that requires action to be resolved.

Let's remember this. The shadow of an unseen object changes with point from which the light is cast. My hope is that by casting a thousand lights, we may come to recognize the truths that matter and use it to fight back. Right now.
