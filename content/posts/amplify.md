My friends have heard me go on-and-on about code for years. I feel they deserve, finally, an explanation as to why I find it so immensely important and fascinating. I'd like to deconstruct what I actually mean when I use the term "code."

I am not referring to the text that I write on the screen - the "code" itself. I am not referring to the process of writing said text, the process of *"coding"*. These two things - the *code* and the process of writing it - are the most visible pieces of what I am so passionate about, but they are beside the point. It is not why I do it.

There are those that enjoy waxing cars to an immaculate shine. Others enjoy talking about the technical stuff: horsepower, miles per gallon, "0 - 60 times". Others enjoy talking about the history of car brands and the minds that made them. Others still enjoy discussions of self-driving cars and the moral implications that come with it. And yet others still purchase them as status symbols.

But if somehow, all the rubber in the world had burnt up and we no longer could produce tires for the cars to move, I would bet good money that car culture, with all its nuanced subcultures and sub-subcultures, would die out. And all but the scientists and the historians would lose interest.

I am operating on a few assumptions, but I think they're safe ones. 

I believe that it's because at its core, car culture is not about immaculate paint jobs, or horsepower comparisons. The culture is upheld by a shared excitement about *what a car represents*: a sense of unparalleled freedom and potential. It is the reason people enter the culture.

Driving on the freeway with friends en route to a beach, or a concert, or even a late night Target run - this is the reason we like our cars. Take this away, and you are left with an expensive and useless pile of metal and leather. In our little scenario where cars no longer could move, all future generations - those who have never known the whipping winds of highway driving - might ridicule Porsche owners as being incompetent stewards of their money.

Simon Sinen is a motivational speaker and marketing consultant. He's known for repeating a particular phrase: 

> "People don't buy what you do, they buy *why* you do it." 

It is this claim that I'd like to echo here and now. Car culture is not about paint, it's about freedom. Code is not about text. It is about problem-solving. 

Or, more accurately, about leveraging the ungodly power of modern computers to solve your problems for you. 

In one comedy bit, Louis CK famously chastises people who whine about their cellphones and delayed flights:

> We have this beautiful thing...and we *hate* it. I've never seen a person going, "look at what my phone can do!" Nobody does that. They all go, "look at this fuckin' thing, it sucks!" (...) No it doesn't! It's amazing! The shittiest cellphone in the world is a *miracle*! (...) People complain about flights: 'I had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes!' Oh really, what happened after that? Did you **fly through the air?** Like a **bird?** Incredibly? Did you soar into the clouds - impossibly?

In the routine, you can see Louis CK's genuine frustration at the forefront. He throws his arms up in disbelief, swearing left and right in an attempt to get the audience to step back for a moment, that they might dispel their daily-reinforced delusion that cellphones and planes are anything other than impossibly sophisticated pieces of machinery. Paradigm-changing achievements that, so many years ago, changed the landscape of humanity forever.

I am still young. But everywhere I look, I see evidence that suggests plainly that *this is how humans are*. We take things for granted. Of course there are exceptions and I don't mean to pain us as mindless lemmings. But on average, I think this to be true. And even for the best among us, I think it is true during certain times of stress or certain seasons of life. I don't think there are enough exceptions to disprove the rule.

At this juncture, I don't think it is an over-dramatization to say that we are literally drowning in excess and burning our time and money away to meaningless pursuits. Due to an overwhelming bombardment of advertisement and social pressures, all underscored by our individual struggles to stay financially afloat, find acceptance, stay fit, etc, I again don't think it's an over-dramatization to say that the average modern citizen has become paralyzed in a way.

This is all getting very existential very fast. But I assure you it's relevant. Because when I say that I want to get better at code, it's because I believe that code - in all its multivariate forms - is precisely *the tool* by which wicked people will try to systematically suppress their peers for greed. We talk about institutional racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression. 

The definition of `Institution` is:

> a society or organization founded for a religious, educational, social, or similar purpose.

What is a codebase, if not an entity built to serve a purpose, except one without all the inherent flaws that come with humans?
