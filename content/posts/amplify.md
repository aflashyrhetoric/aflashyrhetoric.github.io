## Amplify

My friends have heard me go on-and-on about code for years. I feel they deserve, finally, an explanation as to why I find it so immensely important and fascinating. I'd like to deconstruct what I actually mean when I use the term "code."

I am not referring to the text that I write on the screen - the "code" itself. I am not referring to the process of writing said text, the process of *"coding"*. These two things - the *code* and the process of writing it - are the most visible pieces of what I am so passionate about, but they are beside the point. It is not why I do it.

There are those that enjoy waxing cars to an immaculate shine. Others enjoy talking about the technical specs: horsepower, miles per gallon, "0 - 60 in 3 seconds flat." Others enjoy talking about the history of car brands and the minds that made them. Others still enjoy discussions of self-driving cars and the moral implications that come with it. And yet others still purchase cars as status symbols.

But if somehow, all the rubber in the world had burnt up and we no longer could produce tires for the cars to move, I would bet good money that car culture, with all its nuanced subcultures and sub-subcultures, would die out. *Fast*. And only the scientists and the historians would remain.

<small>I'm implicitly operating on a few assumptions, but I think they're safe ones.</small>

I believe that it's because at its core, car culture is not actually about immaculate paint jobs, or horsepower comparisons. The culture is upheld by a shared excitement about *what a car represents to them*. 

To some, its a sense of unparalleled freedom and potential. 
To others, a way to say, "I am undeniably more wealthy than you." 
To others, a way to say, "I'm environmentally conscious," or "I like to invest in bleeding edge tech."

Whatever the individual's specific interest, they are secondary in nature, because the core function is assumed and guaranteed. Remove a car's core function as a mode of transportation and all subcultures collapse into near-meaningless window dressing. A Porsche without wheels is a grotesquely overpriced ornament for your driveway. A Prius without wheels does nothing to transition us to a more economically-friendly society. 

In a world without wheels, all future generations - those who have never known the whipping winds of highway driving - might ridicule luxury car owners as being incompetent stewards of their money.

Simon Sinek is a motivational speaker and marketing consultant. He's known for repeating a particular phrase: 

> "People don't buy what you do, they buy *why* you do it." 

It's this claim that I'd like to echo here and now. Car culture is not about paint, it's about freedom. Or eco-friendliness. Or status. 

#### Code is not about text. It's not about writing text.

Of course not. That would be ludicrous.

It is generally about problem-solving, but it's not singularly about that either. It is, to my knowledge, the only thing in the universe quite like it. Cars are cars. But "code" is a multitool. You can write code that generates art or music. You can disseminate information to millions. You can write code that steals, that lies, that deceives.

The term `code` has several definitions. The most obviously relevant one is something like: "a set of program instructions for computers." Here's another:

> a system of words, letters, figures, or other symbols substituted for other words, letters, etc.

I'd argue this definition is more accurate. Code is precisely Man's best attempt at codifying our thoughts to another medium in a way that retains its function. It is a terse, readable, shareable, debuggable representation of *human intention*. 

This is what is fascinating about it. It is what I love and what I find all-consuming about it. Not the stickers on my laptop, not the novelty of knowing dozens of different acronyms. 

I study because I want to learn how to leverage the ungodly power of modern computers to solve my problems for me.
