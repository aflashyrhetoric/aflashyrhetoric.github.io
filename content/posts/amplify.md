## Utopia 

> The surest way to win a war is to convince your enemy that there's no war at all.

It's a truism to say that the world is not as it should be.

But it's my belief that we've collectively lost sight of just how grotesquely imbalanced things actually are. 

Well, that's not the whole picture - ignorance is just a part of the issue. There are those who simply don't know. Then, there are those who know but have lost hope. Others still who know but simply don't care.

And then there are those select few that *know* and gleefully perpetuate the imbalance. The ones who are ecstatic that you don't know, don't care, and sit hopeless.

I am not here to recruit you to a cause or to perpetuate an ideology. I aim to give you a set of data and then ask you a series of questions. My hope is that by the end of all this, one of two outcomes will come to pass:

Either, I will understand what the fuck is going on, or, you will. 

Because one of us is behaving insanely. And I'm going mad trying to figure out who it is.

First, a grand question to guide all other questions: "Are we at an acceptable place in society?"

If you've any ambition or empathy at all, the answer is no. Unless you're one of the exorbitantly wealthy people whose social circles entirely exclude people of the middle and lower classes, it's safe to say that either you or someone you know is suffering.

Alright, so we're not in a Utopia. Moving on:

Are we making progress to *change* things to the way they should be? Are we getting closer to some ideal?

I think yes. There are politicians, charities, individuals, and institutions that are actively and strategically trying to improve the state of society. We're making progress.

Now, a third question: Are we making progress *fast enough*? 

I think not. 

I'm here to discuss the men, women, and legal clauses that have rebranded the trudge through a convoluted maze as "The American Dream." The ones who literally use formulas to make sure you're not too content, not too sad, but just content enough to remain an inert and loyal consumer. The ones who perpetuate the illusion of choice.
