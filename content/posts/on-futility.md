An elderly woman wakes up at 7AM on a brisk Saturday morning. She picks up a bucket of white paint - an impulse buy from a week prior at a local Sherwin-Williams. Grabbing a brush and a tattered rag, she walks to the backyard.

She lives in the lower level of a duplex, so the backyard is hers. Lining the perimeter is an old fence - rusty streaks snake downward from every unsealed joint and the sight casts a macabre pallor over the space. But the paint she bought was a bright white, with built-in primer. "The good stuff," the salesman had said. And today was the perfect day to paint.

She stirs the paint, dips the brush, and makes quick work of the fence.

Taking a step back, she checks her handiwork - all the stray drips and flecks _add_ to the look, she decides.

She looks up, ignoring the muted spark of pain in her neck, the tired throb in her wrist from painting, and inhales the sky. It's important to be spontaneous, she thinks.

A hundred nearby Alexa devices pipe up. Something about an incoming thunderstorm with risk of areal floods. She doesn't hear it.

Three houses down, a software engineer sleeps in his bed. A scheduled script fires silently on his home server. A flurry of web crawlers begin recursively scraping web pages, scanning coupon aggregation websites for deals on ceramic planters. A dozen `Promises` resolve, and the script hurriedly transforms all the API responses into JSON Schema-compliant data blobs, ready for consumption. A weather API indicates an incoming thunderstorm, and the script's execution path veers down an `else` clause he had written last April during a particularly rainy week. All of his Trello cards tagged with the label `Outdoors` are postponed by 1 week and re-shuffled to next week. The script completes, as a nearby coffee pot begins to burble from a now-empty reservoir. His phone alarm fires, and he turns in his bed.

She smiles.

He frowns.
