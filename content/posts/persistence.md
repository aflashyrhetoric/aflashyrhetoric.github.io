One week, you notice that you woke up at exactly 7:30AM on days where it rained. The next week, the pattern holds. One day, you decide to test it. You sleep late at 3AM. But sure enough, at 7:30AM, your eyes peel open and you stare at the clock on your phone, confused. To even think that there's some greater significance to this coincidence would be childish - right?

But the question sits like an itch inside your chest, so you test it. You decide to test whether the relationship between **your waking time** and the **weather** is reactionary, causal, or coincidental. In other words, is it raining because you wake up at 7:30AM, or are you waking up at 7:30AM because it's raining? Or is it just a coincidence? 

> "It's obviously a coincidence," you think quietly as you bite into the toaster strudel. "But..."

The next day, you set an alarm for 7:30AM. You wake up to sunny skies. So, then, it's not causal. You curse, because it'd be dope to be able to control the weather.

So, then, do you wake up at 7:30AM *because* it's raining? That's significantly less cool, but still interesting. But then you realize that weather is extremely regional. Rain in New York doesn't mean it's raining in France, or even Massachusetts for that matter. 

In any case, months pass and you forget about this weird coincidental pattern, though you do notice it on the days it occurs. You hear of an upcoming business trip at work. You're going to Uruguay to study the local market. 

The day comes and you arrive in Uruguay after a seemingly thousand-hour flight. You head to your hotel, lie in bed, and drift off to sleep. At 7:30AM, you wake up to sunny skies. 

"Well, that's that," you think, chuckling. You fluff your pillow and turn in for 30 more minutes...

...until a thought strikes you. You reach for your phone and flick open the weather app. No WiFi. You grunt and call Dan from back home.

> "Yo, Dan, is it raining?"

> "What?"

> "Is it raining there?"

> "No."

You roll your eyes, mildly disappointed that you even -

> "Wait...yeah. It's raining. Sorry, I was- "

You hang up and hold your breath.

What?

So, when it's raining in your hometown, you wake up at 7:30AM. No matter where you are in the world. You look out the window at the Uruguayan landscape and wonder what you've stumbled upon. What is this thing you've found? What is this Truth? This nugget of - something, seemingly nothing, something confusing and fascinating.

Your mind reels. You call Dan back.

> "Dan, I... Uh, I found something trippy."
> "Man, you hung up on me. Made me sad. But what do you mean?"
> I noticed that whenever it's raining back home, I wake up at exactly 7:30AM
> Aw, cool man. I'ma head back to sleep though, so-

You hang up and hold your breath again.

## On The Pursuit of Truth

For three years, I've been trying to write this same post. To find the words. This is probably the fifteenth attempt. This blog post feels, to me, a bit like Arthur pulling the sword from the stone. The words will only come when I'm worthy enough to publish them. 

I want to characterize the pursuit of truth. I mean *truth* in an infinitely general sense.
