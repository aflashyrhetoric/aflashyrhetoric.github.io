### June 1st, 2016, 6pm

I pause the Javascript tutorial I'm watching. `CMD+W`. Whatever - I'll just revisit ES6 tomorrow. I glance at the thirty-something Chrome tabs I have open and just now notice the whirring fan, the heat emanating off the keyboard. I click the `OneTab` icon to save them all and watch as they disappear, one-by-one.

> "Tomorrow." 

I roll off the couch onto the floor and sit up. The carpet is rough, but the change of posture feels nice. 

Huh, it's still bright out. It's still weird after what felt like a 10-month winter. I look at the clouds and remember an old article about how true randomness can be sufficiently simulated by measuring weather conditions in the air and using the resultant constant as a *seed* in a formula. Something like that, anyways.

The sink is full of dirty dishes. Move dissimilar plates to the side, group all similar ones. Wash one big cup first, followed by utensils. Store clean utensils in the initial clean cup.

Hot water is better at breaking the chemical bonds that cause stubborn food crumbs to adhere to plates. It's also better for washing away dish soap. Begin by bombarding the sponge with hot water for at least 1 minute to kill latent bacteria - I read somewhere that this is just as effective as microwaving the sponge. 

Clean dishes by starting with the similar plates. After they're clean, the newly added sink real estate makes it easier to handle the irregular plates. Soon before finishing, fill up the Brita pitcher so it has time to filter.

Eh. Laundry hamper is getting full. No real way to speed that up except by using **Quick Wash 25 Minute**. I don't have expensive clothes - I don't need `Deluxe Permanent Press`.

Sit down at the PC. Hover over the `League of Legends` icon. Double-click and login. Look at the clock. It'd be dark by the time I finish a game. I close my eyes and wonder if losing a game would demoralize me and hurt my willingness to resume studying tomorrow. Wonder if I have the discipline and resolve to study anyway, like a *real* coder would. Close the game because I don't want to risk it.

No new emails. Nothing on Kakaotalk, Tumblr, Snapchat, Instagram. Open and close Reddit.

Navigate to my OneTab dashboard and selectively restore my Javascript tutorial video. Pause. Navigate to iTerm and try out different fonts. Settle on Inconsolata, like always.
```shell
cd ~/projects; ls
ls 
ls 
ls 
aowiefjaoijf
sl 
```
Heh. Train.
```shell
cd ~/projects/js-sandbox2
sublime .
```
Change the font to Inconsolata to match.
```javascript
// testModule.js
module.exports = newFunction;

// main.js
import 'newFunction' from './testModule';
```
Hmm.
`site:reddit.com/r/webdev webpack tutorial`

Eh.
`site:stackoverflow.com webpack error`

Oh!
```shell
brew install nvm
nvm install 6.9.10
nvm use 6.9.10
touch .nvmrc; echo '6.9.10' >> .nvmrc
git add -A; git commit -m "lol"; gp
```
Copy and paste `gulpfile.js` because `webpack.config.js` is still not working out. I'm sleepy...

Webpack is working now.

hahah never mind

I read about how people are starting to 3D print food. Realized that one day, `burger.make(toppings)` may very well be real.

Realize that the argument:

> yeah code is fun for tinkering and little apps, but you can't code a burger into existence and feed the hungry

will soon be severely demoted from a fundamental truism to absolute pedantry.

Smile.

Look at my TeamTreehouse billing history. Browse LinkedIn and notice my friends 2-year work anniversary. Browse instagram and notice my friends traveling around the world. Switch back to Terminal to a sea of red error messages.

Navigate to Laracasts.com to study the latest Laravel updates.

Try not to cry.

It's my birthday. Udemy doesn't offer coupon codes for birthdays, though.

It'd be nice to have an application to help me manage job applications.

### June 22nd, 2016

`mkdir mosu.io`

### July 5th, 2016

```shell
git add -A;
git commit -m "Readme updated to Mosu 0.1.0"
gp
```

"Good enough for now."

> Hello Kevin. Thank you for your application. We would like you to interview at our office in Manhattan.

Look outside. Try not to cry.

Flip through Spotify. Decide that if I get the position, I'll listen to Cashmere Cat's song, "With Me" on repeat.
