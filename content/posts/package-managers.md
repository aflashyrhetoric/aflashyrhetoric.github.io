### Series Introduction

Zoom back to 2012. I'm in my dorm room trying to learn Ruby on Rails. Everything is going smoothly! Rails seems magical - perhaps a bit too much. I try to add a feature or two, and my progress comes to a screeching halt. I am imprisoned in a jail of "gems". 

And thus, I was introduced to the world of Package Managers.

### 

Associated Language | Package Manager(s) | Configuration Filename|
--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
Javascript| yarn, npm         | package.json
Ruby      | Bundler           | Gemfile
PHP       | Composer          | composer.json
Go        | Glide             | glide.yaml
