I find in myself a contradiction that is seemingly impossible to resolve. Well, actually, it's quite straightforward. But the conclusion *feels* incomplete, though I know it not to be.
The contradiction is this: if I've learned nothing, it is the finitude of self. We graduated from an era at the invention of the computer - it was the day we escaped, in a meaningful way, our finitude. We managed to reduce and translate all manner of tasks to a calculated flickering of bits, and bent the electron to our will.

By our interactions with the computer, we became better at the art of *optimization*, even going so far as to publish articles on over-optimization and premature optimization.

And yet, we - beings of flesh - are so inferior.

And as I continue to develop, I notice this more and more. Though it is, of course, to a lesser extent than those great minds of the past, I find myself bound by my peers. Or - more accurately - by my perception of how I will be received by my peers if I were to show my true self. 

I know now that I am not a genius. If there are aspects of genius in me, it is due largely to the blessings of life that have afforded me the time to work on myself, on my mind - the time to work toward solving greater puzzles.

And yet - that is wholly irrelevant - isn't it? I am irrelevant in this matter, genius or fool, I am irrelevant. What matters is the work. And the work is not getting done because of my peers.

And so the ugly question, abstracted, rises again, as it has so often before: "which is the nobler goal, happiness now or happiness later?"

Again, the vice grip, again the feeling of suffocating finitude wraps its wiry fingers around my throat. To trade pleasures now for greater pleasures later - this is a
