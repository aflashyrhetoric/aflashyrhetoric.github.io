## Write about each of these things

imprecise accusations --> shaming rebuttals --> placing onus on correct hearing rather than correct speaking (can talk here about korean language impreciseness)
  kill all men
  "not all men"
  "feminism is toxic"
  black people stereotypes
multiple definitions, most arguments are semantic
  "racism"
  "toxic masculinity"
  "white privilege"
literally, some people are not good at arguing
people arguing as if the conclusion to that specific argument will be irreversible later, so they're unwilling to yield
"gotcha" debate being the norm
lowering standards 
unproductive handling of stalemates
  abortion
unwillingness to accept flaws of their own side
  why bother?
  obama
  trump
not asking, "is this really a part of my identity?" enough, and making unassailable many things that should be criticized on an individual level
motivational beliefs often encourage a disregard for realism that is meant to bolster the self. this cannot and should not be the same way that you interpret other people's lived stories. 
quick to accuse

## biggest problem
all of this requires nuance, and we have nowhere to seek that out.



### ERASE THE BOTTOM STUFF WHEN YOU GO TO WRITE:
### slug should equal the image path 
### ogdescription is for Facebook and image previews
