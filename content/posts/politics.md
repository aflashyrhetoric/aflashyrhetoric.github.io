Mastering leetcode isn't enough - raw programming ability will get you to a point, but no further. If you're a developer, learn this stuff.

## Political Awareness

Not that kind. Unless you're in a garage startup, you're going to be working in an environment with other engineers, designers, and stakeholders. There could also be dedicated project managers, UX researchers, and more. It's an arena of conflicting tensions and knowing how to navigate that space is important.

Going into an iteration planning meeting with nothing but a laundry list of tech-debt items that you want to fix (or features that you want to build) will do little more than evince the fact that you provide a very singular kind of value to the company. If you're a junior, or if you're okay with being a "cog" to an extent - that's perfectly pardonable. But for those who are less interested in being a purist about doing only engineering work, and more interested in maximizing their value to the company, it's good to be cognizant of essentially as much of the following as possible:

- what problems are we facing, and what are opportunities for improvement?
- what are some potential solutions?
- what are the tradeoffs of one solution vs another in terms of time, cost, and benefit?
- who benefits the most from this problem being solved?
- if we dedicate resources to fixing these problems, what other problems are being postponed? Who are the people who have to bear that burden?
- if possible, it's also good to know the historical context you're working in, so as to be sensitive and respectful of past work.
- who are the strong personalities in the room?
- do people in the room prefer more casual discussion, or straight-forward, serious discussion?

Of course, no one can be on top of all of this 100% of the time. But knowing these things can help you calibrate your words in a way that helps maximize buy-in, rally people around a single cause, and generally help keep morale up. Creating win-win scenarios (or at least, win-neutral scenarios) can give you well-earned clout that you can leverage later to rally people around something you believe in.

## Time for some examples

Suppose you have an iteration/sprint/project planning meeting for everyone to gather and coordinate their workload for the next project or sprint or whatever.

You want to revamp the UI of the "Settings" screen in your application, because you think it's unintuitive. Let's consider a bad, better, and best example:

The "Bad" Example:

> Hey y'all. So, it's clear that the Settings page desperately needs some work. I'd like to go in and change the sizing of the buttons, make the fonts larger, and increase page performance. It's an obvious thing that should've been done years ago, honestly. It'll only take an afternoon.

Why is this kinda bad?

- Because Sarah, the one who developed the initial version of the Settings page, didn't prioritize styling because the company didn't have an MVP yet, the product is internal-only, and because she had 3 other deadlines to meet that sprint. But you didn't know that, and you're disrespecting that hard work.
- Because unless you're a UI/UX designer, or unless the font-size is literally 1px, inflexibly pursuing specific solutions to problems before you even get buy-in, feedback, and context from the team is just arrogant. Even if you're right, there's a better way.
- Revamping the UI/UX almost never takes a single afternoon. Slapping a low time estimate to "sweeten the deal" is just a recipe for disappointment later on.

The "Better" Example

> Hi everyone. I'd like to suggest taking a second look at the Settings page. It's great and got us this far, but I think there's room for improvement. By doing some things like increasing font-size and tweaking button size, we can meet accessibility guidelines and make the page easier on the eyes. It might also give us a good time window to do cosmetic touch-ups on the homepage and navbar as well, which is something that users seem to want based on our heatmap data. I'll get started today, and I'm hoping it'll take about a day.

Why is this better?

- Respectful of past contributions, more cooperative and humbler tone overall.
- Offers specific recommendations on how to fix the problem, but as suggestions and not prescriptions.
- Quickly explores other "quick-wins" that might also be desirable to others.
- Ties the criticism of "this UI is counter-intuitive" to some actual data - the heatmap.
- Slightly more realistic time estimate.

The "Best", in my opinion.

- Hi everyone. We're getting some heatmap data that suggests that our internal users, as well as our customers, are having trouble navigating our applications. The Settings page is functional and bug-free, but users seem to be unable to find what they want quickly. I thought about this and think there are some cosmetic updates we can make to improve the situation. Hey Amy and Joe, I'd like to talk to y'all after this about the possibility of implementing these changes as an A/B Test to ensure we're headed in the right direction. It should take about a day and a half, and I'll time-box any further tweaks to within that time. If people are onboard, I'll write the story and work it into this next iteration.

Why is this the best?

- First of all, depending on your team's culture, of course this might be overly formal, or unnecessary. But it's a safe tone to adopt.
- Leads with the data by mentioning the heatmap data first, which changes the context from, "I think this is bad and confusing" to something concrete.
- Is respectful of past work, gives credit where it's due by acknowledging what the Settings Page does right.
- Loops other people into this, demonstrating that while you have an informed opinion, you're not automatically assuming your own word is gospel.
- By implementing it as an A/B Test, you acknowledge that the goal is not to do it your way, but to get it right, and move forward based on data.
- Acknowledges a more realistic time-frame, and acknowledges what you'll do if you start to spend too much time on it.
- Subtly invites people to protest if they want to.
- Puts the onus on you to create the initial task in your project management software, demonstrating that you're taking ownership over this.
- Overall, still incredibly succinct.

This is better.
