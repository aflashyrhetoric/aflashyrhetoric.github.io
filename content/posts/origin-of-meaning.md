A note: These are personal reflections and in its current state is an incomplete, semi-coherent ramble. It's a WIP, but I've made a personal rule to publish everything that's made it past the second draft.

## Origin of Meaning

In my head, I always fondly referred to them as my "Playground Philosopher" years - that chapter of my life which yielded a library of half-baked philosophical treatises, overly sentimental poetry and diffuse rants about I-don't-even-know-what. And though I disagree with half of the things I wrote during those years, I still smile at the search for knowledge that those nighttime scrawls so embarrassingly evinced. It was a time of wondering about the myriad rules and patterns that govern our individual realities and, in turn, play causal roles in shaping our identities.

Every new person was a new story, which in turn begot a new hypothesis about the patterns that had combined to "create" them, my perhaps-Sisyphean attempt to coax the complexities of identity through a proverbial Sieve of Fourier Transformation in order to decompose all my friends and all my enemies to their component parts. Stereotypes broke apart and resynthesized a thousand times over and what remained was a rich library of character archetypes that more-or-less held true.

Seemingly complex phenomena could now be distilled and categorized, if one was willing to glaze over circumstantial minutiae: a bully's seemingly causeless sadism, a politician's interminable and boundless corruption, a mob's incorrigible wrath, a toxic couple's mutually assured destruction, a soldier's blind loyalty, ad infinitum - all of these deeply human behaviors more-or-less became chapters in a book of archetypes. I suspect that you, too, have such a "textbook." I would never pretend to fully know anyone, nor would I pretend that this _textbook_ is anything other than _woefully incomplete_, but it nevertheless has served as a valuable starting point for _understanding_ the people around me. It was, after all, a collection of observations gleaned _from_, rather than a book of stereotypes imposed _upon_.

Continuing. Of all the chapters in this textbook, only some subset will, at any given time, have relevance to each of us. An artist does not care much about the fighter pilot's plight, and vice versa.

But now, thinking on all the storied personalities I've had the pleasure of encountering, a useful meta-pattern is beginning to come into focus: the way in which each of us derive meaning from our lives.

Obviously, at the highest level, every life more or aligns to a cyclical pattern of pursuing some goal, achieving that goal, pursuing a new goal, and so on. But zooming out one level further - my current hypothesis is that we derive meaning from our lives from completing one of two _types_ of tasks: those tasks that work to restore equilibrium, and those tasks that seek to push the state of any given system _past_ equilibrium to some desirable, net-positive state.

Baking bread for food to survive is the former. Baking raspberry pies, simply because they _taste better_ and make us happy, is the latter.

On the smallest of scales, of course the average person is fine at both - we know how to apply band-aids and most of us have some special indulgence or hobby in which we regularly partake to allay the ever-encroaching existential dread that conspires to torment every waking moment of this ceaseless tide of random sensorial permutations that ehhhhhhhh....

Anyways, to clarify, I'm referring to a generally longer time scale, and generally "larger" tasks. Things of more significance: not the task of getting a single touchdown, but the task of joining the NFL. Not the task of healing from a miniscule scrape, but the task of healing a broken bone.

My secondary hypothesis is thus: the average human is far more likely to specialize in _one_ of these rather than remarkably excel at both of them, because succeeding at both requires two things: firstly, a near-indefatigable spirit. Second, true open-mindedness. I know these seem like random over-simplifications plucked out of a grab bag of character traits, but that's precisely why I'm writing this down, because these two specific qualities seem to emerge, time and time again, in all the outliers.

What I mean by "near-indefatigable spirit" is simple enough: grit. Persisting in a course of action without little regard to discouragement, difficulties, or past failures. 

"True" open-mindedness, I'd like to define explicitly. At the risk of committing a "No True Scotsman," I offer the following definition: the ability to consider alternative frameworks of thought without prejudice to its source and without regard to the extent to which that altering framework of thought differs from one's current beliefs. In short, I am putting a name to the magical quality that would allow a staunch Republican or Democrat to unreservedly switch parties, assuming they're given sufficient proof that they should. Try as we might, this isn't easy, because our beliefs are core to our identities. Very few who identify as "being open-minded" truly fit the bill in any meaningful way.

My final hypothesis attempts to posit why this is the state of things, and has two parts:

First, the reason that we are so bad at having grit, is because _on average_, our social support systems (simply friends, family, etc) are not "strong" enough that the average individual can _even come close_ to having grit, since that is simply not how we operate. Though the phrase, "No man is an island" has been an idiom for some time, this thought has not actually permeated our culture. The romanticized notion of singular, exceptionally motivated and capable individuals changing the world has become the unrealistic standard by which achievement is measured. And that's short-sighted. This idea weasles its way into our power structures, our romantic standards, our individual identities, and more, and is akin to building our financial strategies after those who have won the lottery. Though to varying degrees, we are all invariably social, codependent creatures, but this idea keeps us from being our best. 

Second, the reason we are so bad at being open-minded, is because so-called "True Open-Mindedness" is incredibly alienating. Belief systems are a crux that binds groups together at all scales, and all belief systems are imperfect. Especially at the level of an entire regional culture, it is unfeasible that correction and growth can happen at the pace it needs to, so these corrections must be had at the individual level. But nuance is the enemy of conformity, and simply - we all want to belong.
