## Origin of Meaning

In my head, I always fondly referred to them as my "Playground Philosopher" years - that chapter of my life which yielded a library of half-baked philosophical treatises, overly sentimental poetry and diffuse rants. But bad poetry aside, that time was, chiefly, a time of observation. A time of wondering about the myriad rules and patterns that govern our realities. Each observation begot a hypothesis about the patterns that had combined to create it, an attempt to violently force the complexities of life through a proverbial Sieve of Fourier Transformation in order to decompose them to their component parts. And as experience tested my theories, my theories evolved in kind.

Seemingly complex phenomenons could now be logically distilled, categorized, sorted away. A bully's seemingly causeless torture, a politician's interminable and boundless corruption, a mob's incorrigible wrath, a couple's mutually assured destruction, a soldier's blind loyalty, ad infinitum - all of these deeply human phenomenons more-or-less became chapters in a textbook, and I was satisfied with the consistency of the rich conceptual taxonomy that eventually emerged.

I suppose this taxonomy, held so heavy in my soul, is the beginnings of that evasive quality Wisdom that my mother taught me to pray for all those years ago. But anyway.

Of all the chapters in the textbook, only some subset will, at any given time, have relevance to each of us. An artist does not care much about the fighter pilot's plight, and vice versa.

But with all the storied examples I can now recall to memory, a useful meta-pattern is beginning to come into focus: the way in which each of us derive meaning from our lives.

Obviously, at the highest level, every life more or aligns to a cyclicalpattern of pursuing some goal (whether that's toppling a government or simply eating the next meal), achieving that goal, and so on. But venturing one level deeper - my current hypothesis is that we derive meaning from our lives from one of two _types_ of tasks: those tasks that seek to restore equilibrium, and those tasks that seek to push the state of any given system _past_ equilibrium to some desirable, net-positive state.

Baking bread for food to survive is the former. Baking raspberry pies, simply because they _taste better_, is the latter.

On the smallest of scales, yeah, of course the average person is fine at both - we know how to apply band-aids and most of us have some special talent or skill. So, to clarify, I'm referring to a generally longer time scale, and generally "larger" tasks.

My secondary hypothesis is thus: the average human is far more likely to specialize in _one_ of these rather than excel at both of them, because succeeding at both requires two things: firstly, an indefatigable spirit. Second, true open-mindedness. I know these seem like random over-simplifications, but that's precisely why I'm writing this down, because these two specific qualities seem to be the keys.

What I mean by "indefatigable spirit" is simple enough: grit. Persisting in a course of action without regard to discouragement, difficulties, or past failures. 

"True" open-mindedness, I'd like to define explicitly. At the risk of committing a "No True Scotsman," I offer the following definition: the ability to consider alternative frameworks of thought without prejudice to its source and without regard to the extent to which that altering framework of thought differs from one's current beliefs. In short, I am putting a name to the magical quality that would allow a staunch Republican or Democrat to unreservedly switch parties, given sufficient proof that they should. Try as we might, this isn't easy, because our beliefs are core to our identities.

Lastly, though the phrase, "No man is an island" has been an idiom for some time, this thought has not actually permeated our culture. The romanticized notion of singular, exceptionally motivated and capable individuals changing the world has become the standard by which achievement is measured. And that's short-sighted trash. This idea weasles its way into our power structures, our romantic standards, our individual identities, and more. Trash.

My final hypothesis attempts to posit why this is the state of things, and has two parts:

First, the reason that we are so bad at having grit, is because _on average_, our social support systems (simply friends, family, etc) are not strong enough that the average individual can _even come close_ to having grit, since that is simply not how we operate. Though to varying degrees, we are all invariably social, codependent creatures.

Second, the reason we are so bad at being open-minded, is because so-called "True Open-Mindedness" is incredibly alienating. Belief systems are a crux that binds groups together at all scales, and all belief systems are imperfect. Especially at the level of an entire regional culture, it is unfeasible that correction and growth can happen at the pace it needs to, so these corrections must be had at the individual level. But nuance is the enemy of conformity, and simply - we all want to belong.
