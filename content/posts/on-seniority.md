# Seniority

The word "engineer" in Canada means something other than what it does here. I'm not interested in the semantics of 'engineer', which is bound to welcome a dumpster fire of `No True Scotsman`s and the like.

Rather I'm interested in discussing what seniority and leadership looks like in the specific context of web development.

- humility
- communication
- claiming credit but not seeking adulation
- "true" openmindedness which welcomes inconvenient solutions
- building of systems and processes
- appropriately-scaled solutions to answers
