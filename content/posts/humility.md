## On Humility, Learning, and Purpose

I've often heard the question:

> "How long will it take me to learn how to code?" 

Well, let's informally break down some factors that affect a person's ability to learn. Some obvious ones factors: intelligence, persistence, past experience, resourcefulness, and how much time you have to study. Excelling at any one of these means you'll be able to learn far more quickly.

- If you're a genius, you'll be better off.
- If you're extremely persistent, you'll be better off.
- If you've done very similar work in your past, you'll be better off.
- If you know how to answer your own questions, you'll be better off.
- If you can study full-time, you'll be better off.

I propose we've been missing (or willfully ignoring) a piece of the puzzle: humility.

Often, inexperience naturally leads to humility. But I've noticed something interesting about the nature of code and the process of learning it. My own trajectory while learning code wasn't quite exponential, but it certainly wasn't linear. 

As I studied, I started to notice that each lesson would stitch itself with some other lesson from the past, forming a deeper understanding. Learning about package managers taught me about the concept of configuration files, which helped me when learning about nginx. Learning about the ES6 import syntax helped me understand the concept of importing Python modules. Learning regular expressions helped me understand XPATH, which helped me when writing a Python web scraper. Learning about NodeJS helped me understand Apache, learning about JSON Web Tokens helped me to understand OAuth2. Learning about DigitalOcean droplets helped me to understand AWS. *Ad infinitum*.

Like an ill-written search algorithm, I would dive into some rabbit holes while doing bird-eye scans of others. And after a few years of frantic scurrying, I sat under a tree and realized I knew ten thousand more things than I knew before.

This process isn't unique to code. But, I'd argue, that it's only within the realm of code that the *effects* can be described as "exponentially significant." Because code is a multi-tool, it is a variable tool that can change shape to look like anything and solve anything. Learning English informs the process of learning French - sure. But the problem domain that languages are intended to solve are related strictly to *communication*. Knowing English and French and German may equip you to do more, but such communication is single-threaded.

And you know what? It feels good. It's awesome to know how a DNS server works, how RAM works, how browsers work. It's awesome to be able to understand how Amazon AWS outages can affect latency when playing [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/). It's empowering knowing precisely how a VPN can help protect my anonymity.

My mother often quoted Sir Francis Bacon: "knowledge is power." Having been introduced to the quote through Dear Ol Mom, I interpreted this to mean that "by being knowledgeable, you can protect yourself, son." But there's more to it. Power feels good. Knowledge feels good. Power can lead to delusions of grandeur. Knowledge, I've found, can do the same.

And this is a scary thing. It's not uncommon to think that "one day, when I make enough money, all my problems will be solved." But I found that I still fully subscribe to the concept that, "one day, when I know everything, all my problems will be solved."
