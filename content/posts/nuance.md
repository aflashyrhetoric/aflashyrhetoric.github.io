We absolutely suck at having internet-scale conversations.

I was walking along the Long Island Railroad train station when I heard two people loudly arguing. One made the claim: "you can't be racist against white people." The other looked confused and after a bit of silence, could only quiet muster: "wait, are you serious?". (Both of these individuals appeared to be white.) It seems more and more, as benign cat memes are replaced in the daily highlights by more serious conversations, more people are "entering the fray," so to speak, and giving their opinion. 

More conversation is directionally better than silently ignoring societal problems, so I don't think that's a bad thing, but it can also be extremely frustrating. Because the few times I've seen the two arguing parties _actually continue_ the discussion to its logical end, it almost always ends up roughly like this:

Person One: "Wait okay, pause. What do you mean by 'racism' exactly? How are you definining it here?"
Person Two: "I don't know, I guess - any racially-motivated harassment or aggression or oppression."
One: "Ah, okay - yeah. I'm defining it differently here, and was talking specifically about institutional and systemic oppression created and sustained by the demographic majority."
Two: "Oh well, by that definition, I guess racism against white people _cannot_ exist because they are not minorities."
One: "Yeah, thanks. And, I can see your point that obviously if a person specifically hates white people, then they can be definitely be 'racist' by _your_ definition."
Two: "Yeah."

I'm not saying one definition is more or less correct, but rather that many arguments are _semantic_ arguments. Only by first establishing a shared context can the _true_ points of disagreement rise to the surface and be resolved. But the platforms on which these conversations are conducted either _do not assist with_ or worse, _entirely disalllow_ those valuable next steps.

## Platform constraints
Character limits
Lost threads - tiktok commenting 

## Us - and what "doing better" actually looks like
Assuming that the recipients of our criticisms and prescriptions are not emotional individuals but these detached academics who are open-minded and humble.
  That is what ignorance is - and so if you claim to be woke but your only tool of informing others is stigmatizing - I don't respect you
Shaming ignorance is not what wisdom looks like
  - Stigmatization is not the only tool.
Endorsing divisive comments when it support us but not the other
  - Demeaning Trump voters
Taking jabs:
  - "This the same type of people who will"
What is "virtue signalling"?
Fallacies fucking everywhere
A disconnect between the prescriptions we offer and ignoring how they'll actually be received: "do better" is condescending, I hate that phrase.
Using opaque jargon is bad.
Assuming a shared context is not valid.
Putting the onus on the listener to 'hear correctly' is ineffective. High-context culture is bad.Putting the onus on the listener to 'hear correctly' is ineffective. High-context culture is bad.
